Overview: The ABC's of Oregon flora, fauna and et cetera. My name is John Maddin, and I have been creating highly detailed Scratchboard art for a number of years now, and most recently I've made a number of images all dealing with the indigenous plants, animals and other things that illustrate  my home state of Oregon.  The trick is to get this artwork seen by more people.  Eventually what I'd like to do is get an artist booth set up at the local artist market, as well as an online store, but first I need to create some product.  In addition to the Eagle that you see in the profile shot, here's the other images I want to turn into T-Shirts:http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5268310132/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5457808338/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5200829748/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5279739842/in/set-72157625462231399http://www.flickr.com/photos/johnmaddinart/5521055925/in/set-72157625462231399But, of course, like so many starving artists out there, I'm usually financially challenged.  So......The money will be used to:Create an initial line of T-Shirts and Hoodies (we Oregonians LOVE our Hoodies...!).  There will be at least 6 different images, all in various different sizes and colors to choose from. These will then be offered for sale both online at an Amazon.com merchant site as well as down at the local artist market. To learn a little more about me, and to see more of my art work, just check out the other stuff on the Flickr links, or you can visit my web site at www.scratchboardfiend.com/.  Thanks for your support!
