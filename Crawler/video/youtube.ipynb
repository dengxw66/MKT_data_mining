      "评论内容:  Elden Ring doesn't just not flex its size. If you pay attention to the map, its doing everything it can to hide how big its map is.\n",
      "When you get your first map, it is a square just containing west Limgrave and a black cutoff all around the square. Trying to make you believe that is the extend to this map. Faded edges and fog of war cover parts of the map, but the black square cutoff is saying, \"thats all there is here, nothing beyond this border\". Once you start getting more map pieces the black cutoff eventually goes away. Even the way the roundtable hold scales up and down on the map and moves closer to Limgrave when thats the only piece you have is again to trick you into thinking that it is not a very big world.\n",

      "评论内容:  The best part of Dark Souls 1 was the exploration. The game was a bit linear, but you had different paths you could go down, and early on you didn't have teleporting so going somewhere was a journey. If you could see a place in the distance, you most likely could go there. When i started playing Elden ring i got that same feeling, and knew that those distant castles and towers weren't just for looks but entire areas onto themselves.\n",

Back in the early 2000s when the internet didn't have enough game info so most games you played you went blind into it and you had to solve everything by yourself and I just love that freedom the games gives you to explore and be rewarded not just to unlock the map or fill a progression bar, it is just amazing.\n",

      "On the other hand, Elden Ring still has these mountains of content to do, but the game just letting me find the content on my own feels so much better than the traditional Ubisoft open world design template. If there were more open world games like Elden Ring, I feel like I would love them more than I currently do. I'll just have to stick with my dungeon crawlers and mostly linear rpgs until then.\n",

      "评论内容:  Didn't expect this video but i definitely appreciate it. The open-world really does just feel like it was designed as tightly as the areas in their other games, but just on a much more massive scale. The fact that FromSoft were still able to retain the same level of care and detail throughout the entire map, as well as the same spirit of just letting you explore, miss, and find things is really what I find most impressive.\n",

      "评论内容:  One of the primary fun elements of game design CAN be discovery.  Which can be about more than finding a cool item, monster, or view in a game. IT can also be about discovering the game mechanics.  Such as the player realizing how the map system works and also discovering how the painted on features on the map mean something without having to drop objective markers for them.  And how the map options the player have are akin to how a person in real life might mark up a paper map of an area they are visiting.  Such as when  in tv, someone realizes that \"all these murders seem to take place within 2 blocks of this building, so lets circle it\".\n",

So I drop a marker down to come back to it, along with the 4 other markers for things I stumbled across in the overworld along the way—including what I think might be a secret tunnel to another continental mass, and a recurring giant tree boss that's being worshiped by beast person cultists this time—only to realize that it's 3am.

There would be no point in doing so, with my strength/faith build i have a dozen 'characters' I can swap between by changing equipment.  If/When i get bored of that I can ask moon mommy for a changeup.  I'm on my third playthrough at the moment, and still on the SAME character i made on day one.  For someone who chronically restarts every game after a bad start this is cool AF. :3\n",

The game will strongly push you to do those two bosses, but with a couple of secret paths you can actually clear it, and only Margit is required. All mandatory bosses are in the latter half of the game, and you can just pick and choose 2 of the first half to kill and move on.\n",

I mean I can’t go one minute in Elden Ring without there being something whether it being an enemy or just being a random that needs help or helps us. I love how the game doesn’t tell u anything and allows u to discover things on ur own. I love how they don’t punish u for “missing” stuff. Plus, the world is massive.\n",

      "评论内容:  To put it simply, if anyplace looked interesting, if anything looked interesting or sucked going against the players, the players can usually go there and try all those things out themselves as themselves minus the catapults. You combine that with the more exciting and generally interesting looking world layout to checkout and badass boss designs and music, then you essentially got Elden Ring. It's also not just thrown together most of the time and will usually have cryptic clues to various places what's really going on and the people around there for those interested in secrets and stories. Even the catacomb dungeons get extra thought into them for quite a series of brain teasers as you try to go through them, find the lever and face the guarding entity at the end for a neat reward.\n",

      "评论内容:  The Souls games just have good gameplay. Each weapon has its own unique feeling, they typically do enough damage where any of them is viable so the player can experiment, the focus on heavy damage to the enemy and player forces you to evade attacks and play smart since you and your foe are always just a few hits away from dying. From there, the game blossoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think about other video games where every weapon is more or less the same but with higher numbers. Each enemy is the same, but higher numbers. Enemies take dozens of hits to kill, whacking them with a big sword seems to barely scrape away their health and hard bosses are only difficult because of the numbers. Dark Souls might still bullshit us on enemy health and damage at times, but I know if I stab an human enemy they’re almost dead but if they stab me I’m almost dead. To me, that just seems realistic and simple. It means i can run into an area and easily clear the enemy but it means if I fail to consider my surroundings they can kill me just as easily. But the reward is finding a new weapon with a different moveset that opens up different playstyles. It’s fun.\n",

      "评论内容:  I recently watched a video about Skyrim where it has this ability for people to have that sense of wonder as well. The reason people enjoy it and it feels like there is something to discover, because Skyrim doesn’t make it feel like everything is a task, but more of a journey. Granted Skyrim and Elden Ring are pretty different. Where they have it right is in the open world. Where Skyrim doesn’t hide the map from you, but it doesn’t reveal everything to you until you actually reach that point. It becomes a discovery rather than something to complete from a checklist. Maybe what Elden Ring has done isn’t completely new, but perhaps a forgotten element in these games. At least in the case of open world games. Kind of crazy to think, but interesting to think how such a small detail makes massive difference throughout the entire game.\n",

      "评论内容:  I’d love to think that other devs will follow Elden Rings lead & have open worlds that actually feel like open worlds, where you can pretty much do whatever you like, and not just being a dog on a lead being led from one marker to the next. But I know the other devs will just be spiteful of Elden Rings success.\n",

      "the only thing I've found that really bugs me is the lack of any direction in the side quests. im more than happy to do a bit of searching around, but a little more of a clue than \"I might see you again on the road\" would be really nice. I may have missed something, but if it wasn't for YouTube, id have never found the later parts of Millicent's quest line.\n",

      "评论内容:  I feel like RDR2 has a similar effect that you described here. I only felt like I needed to do the story missions at the end of each chapter, but the story itself doesn't have a sense of urgency, only at specific times, and it's usually the last couple missions of each chapter  (example, when jack goes missing at the end of the rhodes chapter). Other than that, icons are revealed in the map as you explore, and details on the map are drawn by hand, implying that the map you see is a physical map that the character has and he draws things that he finds on the paper of the printed map. When I first played the game I felt drawn to explore the map. And you're not locked to any region (only on chapter 1), from the beginning of chapter 2 you can freely explore the entire map, no restrictions. Not to mention the treasure hunts. You get a drawing of some land details and you have to figure out where it is. No marker on the map or anything, only a rather crude drawing.\n",

      "评论内容:  I don't necessarily agree. The map is still evenly littered with super gamified encounters and dungeons. Every cave and catacomb is exactly the same: one site of grace, a series of rooms and enemies, and one boss and one reward item. The only difference is that it doesn't present all of the world activities at the beginning of the game with giant markers, but most of them are clearly distinguished on the map anyway so it doesn't even get points there. I ended up playing elden ring pretty much exactly the same anyway: place my own five map markers and systematically go through every point of interest until I completed the checklist for the area. \n",
      "\n",
      "The difference is that elden ring 'doesn't care' if you find them, but most open worlds don't anyway. They're saying \"here's stuff to do\", they don't usually care if you actually do them. \n",

      "评论内容:  As much as I like Elden Ring, you're being pretty generous with it. The reason it was such a success is because it has a built in fanbase, and devs that aren't stupid and know how to reach out correctly. Take the darksouls out of it, one of the points you made of it being good, and slap a 'standard' combat system on it like Creed or Witcher, and what do you have? A game that expects you to feel your way around with little guidance and just figure out things by random trial and error, as well as troll face level of hidden content. We're STILL finding mechanics that are either not mentioned in any way, even with the benefit of datamining, or hinted at with lines like 'this was used by a craftsman'. The point's been made: If this wasn't a souls game, it would be getting the same treatment Fallout 4 did because of the same flaws it has when trying to do open world. Only difference being is Elden Ring actually runs on launch.\n",

      "评论内容:  As you've explain with the first tree sentinel encounter. This also hints that there is no boss order for even the mandatory bosses. The graces only gives suggestions but never forcing the player to into a linear path. Morgott would be the first hurdle in defeating Godrick to get his ring. But further exploration and you can find that you don't even need to face them both to continue the story.\n",

      "评论内容:  I honestly felt like the game was quite bloated because the map was so large... it lowered the stakes of the boss battles immensely and ended up with so many repeated enemies/rooms/etc. I adored the game for the first 2/3 but the open world made me lose interest really quickly in the back half.\n",
      "So many people compared it to Breath of the Wild, and while there are similarities I think it wasn't as successful as that game. It's definitely not the peak of From games, but, to be honest it makes me more excited for whatever comes next, because you know it will be refined even more.\n",
