They have been involved in advising Boeing on changes to the MAX after two fatal accidents triggered a world-wide grounding of the jet. PHOTO: Andriana Mereuta for The Wall Street Journal Miami After takeoff, the Boeing 737 suddenly warns pilots that the plane is about to lose lift and stall, an erroneous signal from a bad sensor. The control column shakes, loudly. Pilot Roddy Guthrie diagnoses the problemâ€”and then the plane's nose suddenly pitches down, on its own. Emergency No. 2. He pulls back on the control column to keep climbing and gets the airplane back to the proper orientation, nose up. But it happens again, with more force. And then a third time, with even more force, so that he's looking almost straight down at the groundâ€”the most terrifying sight for any pilot. The episode, a repeat of the system failure suspected in two Boeing 737 MAX crashes, takes place in a Boeing full-motion flight simulator Wednesday morning. A few minutes later, Capt. Guthrie and another pilot try again, this time with Boeing's proposed software fixes installedâ€”software that's critical to Boeing, airlines and travelers world-wide. Capt. Guthrie, fleet captain for the 737 at American Airlines, faces the same problem with the faulty sensor. This time the stick shaker gives its same loud warning, the result of the faulty sensor, but the 737's computer never points the airplane down. A yellow caution light comes on and he easily maintains control. ""You don't see compounding emergencies going on,"" Capt. Guthrie says. ""The second emergency never occurs. You've eliminated a major distractor."" He and other pilots at American and other airlines have been voluntarily advising Boeing on fixing its troubled model of the 737, grounded in March after crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed a total of 346 people. Wednesday morning's session was the first time he checked out the changes in a full-motion simulator. (He had tested it previously in a stationary cockpit simulator in Seattle.) Boeing is running actual flight tests of the fix, with regulators world-wide scrutinizing the results. The future of the 737 rests on the fix. Boeing drew loud criticism for failing to inform pilots and the Federal Aviation Administration about all aspects of its now-suspect system when it launched in 2017 and its reticence to act after the crashes. The company must win back the trust of regulators, then airlines, pilots, flight attendants and the traveling public. Many hurdles lie ahead. Though the proposed fix has performed well in tests like Wednesday's simulator session, testers could discover new problems. It's too early to declare the MAX fully repaired. Acting FAA administrator Dan Ewell said in May that October might be too soon for the plane to return to service. In addition to the FAA's review, an outside agency established by the FAA will also review the proposed fixes, and regulators in Europe and Canada have said they planned to conduct separate reviews. Sessions like this have convinced American it needs to put its pilots through additional training related to maintaining control of airplanes when systems fail, whether the FAA requires this or not. (The FAA says it hasn't decided yet on training requirements.) Once the FAA signs off on changes, it will take 45 days for American to train all 4,200 of its 737 pilots. The airline figures that pilots will be the key to restoring faith in the airplane. They need to be convinced it's safe before passengers will be willing to board the 737 MAX again. American requested Boeing to allow me to ride along with Capt. Guthrie and Capt. Alan Johnson, the airline's 737 fleet training and standards manager, as they put the new version of the maneuvering characteristics augmentation system, or MCAS, through its paces. Capt. Guthrie leads Scott McCartney, a pilot, through scenarios in the simulator re-creating conditions that triggered the Lion Air crash in October and the Ethiopian crash in March. PHOTO: Andriana Mereuta for The Wall Street Journal MCAS was added to the flight control computer to help the MAX, which has new engines, handle like previous models of the 737, particularly at slow speeds and when the nose is pitched high. When functioning normally, MCAS helps prevent the airplane from getting so nose-high that the wings stop producing lift and stall. When an airplane stalls, it becomes a rock. I'm a private pilot with about 1,000 hours in my logbooks, including time in planes this size and larger. I flew the MAX simulator with the prior MCAS software, known as version 11.1, and the proposed fix, version 12.1. I found it to be a night-and-day difference. Even though I knew what was coming and had seen two veteran pilots demonstrate proper recovery procedures, I struggled to maintain control with the old system. MCAS pushes the nose down with such cumulative force if you don't use the exact prescribed procedures that as hard as you pull back on the control column, you can't get the nose pointing up. ""It's not a good feeling,"" Capt. Guthrie says. With the new version, the problem with the faulty sensor in this test appears to become, essentially, a routine emergencyâ€”something pilots can handle while getting the airplane to the nearest suitable runway. MCAS doesn't fire at all, leaving you with just the initial problem of the single faulty input. ""You just shut the faulty system down and the airplane still operates normally. It's very manageable,"" Capt. Johnson says of the MAX with version 12.1. ""It's like taking away your cruise control in your car."" Scott McCartney, left, interviews the pilots outside the Boeing simulator. American will be getting its own MAX simulator in December. PHOTO: Andriana Mereuta for The Wall Street Journal MCAS takes information from a single vane near the nose of the airplane. The 737 has two angle-of-attack vanes, but version 11.1 of MCAS only used one at a time. If that vane were broken, the system could activate erroneously and angle the plane's nose down, thinking it was preventing a nose-high stall. Fix No. 1 to MCAS is that in version 12.1, it will take input from both sensors. If they disagree by 5.5 degrees or more, MCAS will shut down and not fire at all. With the troubled version of MCAS, pilots would instinctively pull back on their control columnâ€”or yokeâ€”to keep the nose up when MCAS is pushing it down. And they'd use a switch on the control column to trim the airplane to a desired orientation. The trim switch can counteract the inputs from MCAS. But once you release the trim switch, MCAS 11.1 fires again after five seconds because the erroneous data from the broken sensor remains. And it will keep firing five seconds after you stop moving the trimâ€”the effect can be cumulative, so each time the nose points down more sharply. Fix No. 2 to MCAS is that the system will only fire once. Under the original version, Boeing assumed that pilots would diagnose the repeated downward pitch movements as ""runaway trim,"" something they used to train for more frequently. Runaway trim in modern planes is rareâ€”American had one incident in its last 750,000 737 flights. Even Capt. Guthrie and Capt. Johnson say they had to brush up on speed-trim system functions after the Lion Air crash into the Java Sea in October. The longstanding prescribed procedure for runaway trim is fairly simple: stabilize the aircraft, then disconnect the system by flipping two toggle switches called the Stab Trim cutout, short for stabilizer trim, that are on the pedestal between pilots just below the throttles. Then you use a wheel beside each pilot's knees to crank in necessary trimâ€”to move the stabilizer manually as needed. The Ethiopian pilots did cut the stabilizer trim off, investigators have said. But with multiple warning alarms sounding and multiple emergencies at hand, they didn't control the speed of the airplane. The plane can get going so fast that a pilot can't move the wheelâ€”think of the force of the wind when you stick your hand out a car at 35 miles an hour, then think of what it might be like at 350 mph. Testing this in the simulator, Capt. Guthrie found he couldn't move the wheel unless I let go of the control column I was pulling back to try to keep the nose up. Relaxing the column momentarily pitched the nose down even more, but removed enough pressure to crank in some trim. That procedure of relaxing pressure to add trim repeatedlyâ€”sometimes called a roller coaster maneuver or a fishing maneuver, may be added to standard procedures for runaway trim, the American pilots say. The Stab Trim cutout switches, located below the throttles, are key to turning off a system that, with its original software, can repeatedly push the nose of the airplane down with force based on erroneous data from a broken instrument. Pilots hope changes to the system will eliminate those problems. PHOTO: Andriana Mereuta for The Wall Street Journal With the fixes in place, the faulty sensor still triggers the stick-shaker stall warning. But unless both sensors break exactly the same way within nanoseconds of each other, MCAS never fires because the angles reported by each sensor will differ. Boeing will also include a message on pilot displays when the readings differ as a standard feature. And if MCAS should somehow erroneously fire, it will only pitch the plane down once, never moving it so sharply that it exceeds the ability of pilots to pull back on the control column and get the nose up. Capt. Guthrie says his testing finds version 12.1 eliminating the problems of version 11.1. ""We are, at this point, quietly confident,"" he says.

In the remarks, Carey says that Boeing engineers made ""many mistakes"" with the plane's automated anti-stall system, which misfired and left the planes out of the pilots' control as they plunged toward the ground, according to the preliminary reports into the two fatal crashes involving the plane. The crashes, in Indonesia in October 2018 and in Ethiopia in March 2019, killed a combined total of 346 people.

An APA spokesman told CNN in May that the second crash could have been avoided if Boeing listened to its pilots. Boeing's previous suggestion that pilot error may have caused the crashes ""offended"" members of the APA, Carey said, as he criticized suggestions from some in the media that training standards may have been lower in the countries where the crashes occurred. ""To make the claim that these accidents would not happen to US-trained pilots is presumptuous and not supported by fact.

Carey will ask Congress if the ""FAA is sufficiently independent of the manufacturers so as to provide a legitimately rigorous audit of the manufacturers' design and engineering."" The FAA's certification system, which allows manufacturers to certify their own planes, has come under fire since the Boeing 737 Max crashes, especially after the acting head of the FAA told Congress in March that Boeing helped to certify the MCAS system itself. The FAA delegates parts of the plane-certification process to aircraft manufacturers as part of a longstanding policy that the FAA is defending. Daniel Elwell, the acting administrator of the FAA, told a Senate committee in March that the system produces safe aircraft, and said that the FAA would need 10,000 more employees and an additional $1.8 billion if it were to be solely responsible for aircraft-safety certifications. Experts told Business Insider in April that the FAA's reputation is under threat and could suffer, endangering its status in the US as the gold standard for aviation safety worldwide. Carey will also ask Congress if the FAA is ""sufficiently equipped"" to make sure pilot training is adequate as the technology on planes becomes more advanced. He will also question whether an aircraft's certification should have an expiration date â€?pointing out that the Max jets were an upgrade of the 737, which was certified in 1967. The FAA told Business Insider in response: ""The FAA's aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs. The 737-MAX certification program took five years and involved 110,000 hours of work on the part of FAA personnel, following the FAA's standard certification process."" It said that its work certifying planes includes ground and flight tests, checking the plane has the required ""maintenance and operational suitability"" to be entered into service, and working with civil aviation authorities as they work to certify the plane.

""Pilot training in the U.S. is the most rigorous and sophisticated in the world.

American Airlines Group,AAL,2019/7/10,social discrimination,"Nightmare Summer American Airlines; Labor tension lousy weather meant higher rates delays cancellations largest U.S. carrier
A federal judge ordered lawyers for American Airlines and its mechanics union to meet in person over an alleged work slowdown, but American's top two attorneys didn't show.
It's been that kind of summer for many American Airlines passengers.
In June, American canceled about 4% of its schedule, or more than 7,500 domestic and international flights, according to masFlight, the flight-data analytics unit of Global Eagle.
Canceled and delayed flights mean missed connections and families stuck, sometimes for several days until the airline has empty seats for rebooking.
If the airline blames bad weather for the flight problems, as has often been the case, it won't pay for hotels and meals.
Still, United and JetBlue canceled less than 1% of their flights compared with American's 4%.
American acknowledges the poor performance and says what has made this summer particularly miserable is its inability to quickly recover from bad weather because so many planes are out of service with maintenance issues.
Every single day when you have that, it's not normal."" American's frequent-flier program recently began calling top customers who have been most affected to apologize, offer compensation, and, if necessary, give them miles toward qualification levels if flights got switched to other airlines.
American refused to pay for a hotel, saying the cause was the weather, not the mechanical delay that prevented the flight from leaving before the bad weather.
A Summer of Cancellations American Airlines is canceling flights at a much higher rate than other airlines, blaming a slowdown by mechanics and bad weather.
Here are the cancellation rates for major airlines for the month of June.
American wasn't willing to pay for an extra night in a hotel, arguing weather the day before caused the cancellation.
(Those filings are also where the anecdote of the delayed American attorneys surfaced.) Mechanics have been taking longer to complete routine work as well, the airline says.
From June 4 to June 13, American says it averaged 61 aircraft unscheduled out of service each day at 7 a.m. In the same period in both the previous two years it averaged around 42, American said in its suit against the union.
An average of 31 flights were canceled each day by the maintenance slowdown in early June.
The mechanics union, a collaboration of the Transport Workers Union, which represented American mechanics, and the International Association of Machinists, which represented US Airways mechanics before the two airlines merged, says it hasn't authorized or urged any slowdown.
American alleges its mechanics union targeted the busy summer travel seasonâ€”when the airline is most vulnerable.
Tips for Surviving Summer Travel American Airlines is battling its mechanics while the entire industry fights Mother Nature this summer.
Remember, if the airline cancels your flight for any reason, you are entitled to a refund for that flight.","A federal judge ordered lawyers for American Airlines and its mechanics union to meet in person over an alleged work slowdown, but American's top two attorneys didn't show. Their flights got canceled. It's been that kind of summer for many American Airlines passengers. Cancellations have skyrocketed. In June, American canceled about 4% of its schedule, or more than 7,500 domestic and international flights, according to masFlight, the flight-data analytics unit of Global Eagle. That June cancellation rate was 18 times Delta's. When the world's largest airline becomes unreliable, travelers get punished. Canceled and delayed flights mean missed connections and families stuck, sometimes for several days until the airline has empty seats for rebooking. Vacations get clipped; sleep gets lost, meetings and events get missed, patience wears thin. On Monday, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio fell victim. ""When @AmericanAir cancels your flight, cancels your rebooked flight & then informs you every flight between Miami & DC is overbooked for the next 24 hours, you know it just isn't your day,"" he said on Twitter. Travelers often end up paying a hefty financial penalty. If the airline blames bad weather for the flight problems, as has often been the case, it won't pay for hotels and meals. Weather has been a major factor, in addition to the contract feud with mechanics. The Dallas area, where American has its largest hub, was hit hard by severe thunderstorms and a few tornadoes on three consecutive Sundays in June. It isn't just Dallasâ€”storms have been more severe this year in many parts of the country, airlines say. On-time arrival rates at United and JetBlue were just as bad as at American in June, all around 70%, according to a data analysis by Cirium, an aviation-data firm. Storms and congestion hit hard in New York. A United spokesman says June had the highest number of weather and air-traffic control delays United has ever seen. Still, United and JetBlue canceled less than 1% of their flights compared with American's 4%. American acknowledges the poor performance and says what has made this summer particularly miserable is its inability to quickly recover from bad weather because so many planes are out of service with maintenance issues. Heard on the Street * Flood of New Jets Will Create Turbulence In the past, the airline could swap planes more easily to cover trips, and spares would go into service. Now, it just cancels more flights. Julie Rath, American's vice president of customer experience, innovation and delivery, says American has been sending people out from headquarters and sales offices to airports to pitch in. The airline has told reservation agents to rebook customers on other airlines if seats are available and they have pressing needs, like a wedding or funeral to get to. American has increased the number of hotels where it offers vouchers for stranded travelers. ""None of us are happy and we completely understand what our customers are going through,"" she says. ""We can't run an operation where we have 55 to 60 aircraft out of service. Every single day when you have that, it's not normal."" American's frequent-flier program recently began calling top customers who have been most affected to apologize, offer compensation, and, if necessary, give them miles toward qualification levels if flights got switched to other airlines. Adam Rodriguez, an immigration attorney from the Washington, D.C., area and top-tier frequent flier on American, is one who could probably use a call. He says American's clumsy handling of problems has caused him to miss hearings and interviews for clients. One flight to Dallas had a maintenance delay, forcing a switch to a different airplane. Then bad weather rolled in and the flight was canceled. American refused to pay for a hotel, saying the cause was the weather, not the mechanical delay that prevented the flight from leaving before the bad weather. Last week he was delayed five hours trying to get from Miami back to Washington, pushing his arrival back to 1 a.m. On Sunday, his 5 p.m. flight home from a weekend anniversary trip to Playa del Carmen, Mexico, was canceled just over half a day before departure. American blamed bad weather. The plane was coming from Miami, but it was the previous flight to Miami where weather delayed the airplane. American told him it would be Tuesday before the carrier could get him out of Mexico. A Summer of Cancellations American Airlines is canceling flights at a much higher rate than other airlines, blaming a slowdown by mechanics and bad weather. Here are the cancellation rates for major airlines for the month of June. * American: 4% * Frontier: 2.56% * Southwest: 2.02% * Spirit: 1.69% * Alaska: 0.83% * United: 0.63% * Allegiant: 0.55% * JetBlue: 0.51% * Delta 0.22% Source: masFlight, the flight-data analytics unit of Global Eagle Pleading with customer-service representatives assigned to top-tier fliers got him a trip home landing at 12:13 a.m. Tuesday. American wasn't willing to pay for an extra night in a hotel, arguing weather the day before caused the cancellation. ""It's a pretty absurd excuse. You're the world's largest airlines. What do you mean you can't find an aircraft within 14 hours?"" Mr. Rodriguez says. ""It's just been one mess after another."" The airline has been negotiating with mechanics since December 2015. Talks stalled and a federal mediator was called in, but there hasn't been a negotiating session since April 25. In court filings, American says mechanics are refusing overtime and ""field trips"" to other airports to fix grounded planes. The airline says it has never had a problem finding takers for overtime or field trips because of the premium pay involved. (Those filings are also where the anecdote of the delayed American attorneys surfaced.) Mechanics have been taking longer to complete routine work as well, the airline says. Travelers say they've had flights delayed when captains announce that mechanics were coming onboard after passengers were seated to read logbooks, or taking hours to taxi an aircraft to a gate for departure. Share Your Thoughts How much trouble have you run into flying this summer? Join the conversation below. From June 4 to June 13, American says it averaged 61 aircraft unscheduled out of service each day at 7 a.m. In the same period in both the previous two years it averaged around 42, American said in its suit against the union. Problems have been escalating in recent days. An average of 31 flights were canceled each day by the maintenance slowdown in early June. By mid-June, American averaged almost 80 maintenance-related cancellations or prolonged delays daily. The mechanics union, a collaboration of the Transport Workers Union, which represented American mechanics, and the International Association of Machinists, which represented US Airways mechanics before the two airlines merged, says it hasn't authorized or urged any slowdown. It blames American's operational problems on American and calls the lawsuit frivolous. This isn't the first time the airline has struggled with on-time arrivals and cancellations compared with competitors. In the annual Middle Seat scorecard of airline operational performance, American has ranked last or next-to-last in 10 of the past 11 years. Work slowdowns in the airline business have hit travelers hard in the past. Southwest Airlines had unusually large numbers of airplanes out of service earlier this year until it settled on a new contract for its mechanics. American alleges its mechanics union targeted the busy summer travel seasonâ€”when the airline is most vulnerable. In a February bulletin to its members, the union tied the summer to ""the fight of our careers"" and said, ""this is shaping up to be a very long, hot summer and not just because of the weather,"" according to a court filing. Federal Judge John McBryde issued a temporary restraining order on June 14 blocking the union from instigating, encouraging or approving any interference with the airline's operations. But that hasn't slowed delays and cancellations. Tips for Surviving Summer Travel American Airlines is battling its mechanics while the entire industry fights Mother Nature this summer. Here are some steps to take to protect your disrupted travels. * Fly early in the day. Thunderstorms are the big threat to summer travel, and they fire up with afternoon heat. * Give yourself extra time. Can't miss a meeting on Monday? Fly in Saturday. Cruise sailing, weddingâ€”whatever the occasion, give yourself extra time. * If making a connection, be prepared to get stuck. Have phone numbers for airport-area hotels. It's better to call the hotel directly when scrambling for accommodations. * Don't book a connection unless you absolutely have to. * Even if the airline blames weather and won't pay, ask about hotel vouchers. Airlines book blocks of rooms at nearby hotels and sometimes offer customers discount coupons. * Keep medicine, phone chargers, other necessities and a change of clothes in a carry-on bag. If you get stranded or rerouted, you may not see your checked luggage for days. * Don't send unaccompanied children on connecting itineraries. With so much disruption, it's best to avoid placing responsibility for children on airline staff. * Use your points. Using them for unexpected hotel stays is often good value. And if you have to get there, you might find using miles on rival airlines for a last-minute ticket is better than spending cash. Remember, if the airline cancels your flight for any reason, you are entitled to a refund for that flight. * Know when to fold 'em. Sometimes it's best to avoid a nerve-racking, extended wait. Get the airline to rebook you for early the next day instead, if possible. Get a room, have a nice dinner, call your mother, find a yoga class, relax. That's better than six hours of futility at the airport only to have the flight ultimately canceled anyway. * Be kind to your fellow travelers and to front-line airline employees. We're all in this together. Write to Scott McCartney at middleseat@wsj.com","<Incident Category>: social discrimination
        <Matched Summary>: American Airlines is canceling flights at a much higher rate than other airlines, blaming a slowdown by mechanics and bad weather.
A federal judge ordered lawyers for American Airlines and its mechanics union to meet in person over an alleged work slowdown, but American's top two attorneys didn't show.
It's been that kind of summer for many American Airlines passengers.
From June 4 to June 13, American says it averaged 61 aircraft unscheduled out of service each day at 7 a.m. In the same period in both the previous two years it averaged around 42, American said in its suit against the union.
An average of 31 flights were canceled each day by the maintenance slowdown in early June.
American alleges its mechanics union targeted the busy summer travel seasonâ€”when the airline is most vulnerable.
The mechanics union, a collaboration of the Transport Workers Union, which represented American mechanics, and the International Association of Machinists, which represented US Airways mechanics before the two airlines merged, says it hasn't authorized or urged any slowdown.
If the airline blames bad weather for the flight problems, as has often been the case, it won't pay for hotels and meals.
If the airline cancels your flight for any reason, you are entitled to a refund for that flight.

        The <Incident Category> of social discrimination is addressed in the summary, as it highlights the issues faced by American Airlines passengers due to the higher cancellation rate and poor weather conditions. The summary also mentions a federal judge ordering a meeting between American Airlines and its mechanics union, which is a form of addressing the social discrimination issue.

American Airlines plans to announce five major new routes on Thursday, including its first flight to the African continent. The routes â€?from three of its hubs, to a total of four different destinations â€?are the latest move as the airline seeks to refocus and reorient its hub and connection network following its acquisition of US Airways in 2013. Four of the routes will run seasonally, beginning in Spring 2020. The fifth â€?between Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas, and Tel Aviv, Israel â€?will operate year-round starting September, 2020.

While the route can serve increasing numbers of Americans looking to vacation in Morocco, American plans to use the destination as a foothold on the continent â€?and potentially in the Middle East â€?feeding traffic to future alliance partner Royal Air Maroc. The Moroccan airline is set to join the Oneworld alliance, of which American is a founding member, in 2020. ""Casablanca is so well located in Africa to be able to connect demand,"" American's Vice President of network and schedule planning, Vasu Raja, told Business Insider. ""Even though they're still in the process of maturing the connecting hub, that enables us to start developing connections to cities like Marrakesh and Lagos, but then over time, cities deeper in Southern and East Africa."" The flight between Philadelphia and Casablanca will be served by a Boeing 757 narrow-body aircraft. The other four flights will be served by 787-8 and 787-9 Dreamliner jets. Read more: The best and worst major airports in the US The bigger picture for American Airlines The routes overall are emblematic of the multifaceted approach American has taken to cut losses, increase efficiency and, by extension, profitability while leveraging the strong domestic network it held following its 2013 merger with US Airways, according to Raja. American has moved much of its connecting capacity out of New York and directed it to other hubs â€?particularly the legacy US Airways hub in Philadelphia â€?instead. The airline retained its presence in New York, using it to serve direct traffic on established routes, like London and Paris, instead. ""For years, AMR  had a presence in New York, but it didn't have enough slots to built a really viable connecting international market out of JFK,"" Raja said. ""US Airways had a hub out of Philadelphia, but the airline wasn't a part of any of the big joint ventures which really would have enabled it to grow."" ""We refashioned trans-Atlantic where we serve the non-stop market out of New York,"" he said. ""In Philadelphia, we go and try and create a lot of connections, and use it to try and start new markets."" A benefit to moving connecting traffic to Philadelphia is that it costs significantly less to operate flights from that airport, adding to American's bottom line, and making it possible to experiment with new markets and routes. The airline launched its first service to Prague and Budapest from the Philadelphia hub in 2018, which has been largely successful, leading it to launch additional flights from Chicago for 2020. ""In Philadelphia, we have a hub that can make more connecting itineraries than any of our competitors' hubs on the East Coast, but it can do it at about 80% of the cost,"" Raja said. ""So it's a really attractive way for us to try things."" Alongside that, it cut unprofitable routes including most of its trans-Pacific service from Chicago. At the same time, it has expanded trans-Atlantic flights from the city, Raja said. Alongside Philadelphia, the two hubs can serve a significant portion of American's trans-Atlantic market via a single connection from a customer's home airport. ""We can offer more cities to more of the connecting customers that really use American Airlines' domestic system,"" Raja said. ""A lot of the small cities in the US have access to a bunch of new international destinations."" ""It's the culmination of many years of remaking American into a profitable international carrier."" The flight from Dallas-Fort Worth to Tel Aviv similarly reflects American's shift away from connecting traffic in the New York market. ""All the service to Tel Aviv is clustered in the big coastal cities on the East and West Coasts,"" said Raja.

When a bad thing happens, it's human nature to try and find an upside â€?or a hope for the future. When the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill, ushered in the age of social distancing, and indefinitely grounded most frequent flyers, the optimists focused on the worst part of modern air travel: the middle seat. ""The coronavirus has effectively killed the middle seat,"" a Popular Mechanics article proclaimed in May. ""Will empty middle seats help social distancing on planes?"" the BBC asked. Here at Business Insider, we wrote about an innovative new seat design that could create a barrier between each coach passenger â€?something a variety of designers have pitched during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines was slammed for selling passengers the empty middle seats next to them as an add-on perk, accused of profiteering on safety. But a few months into our global crisis, it's clear that the general consensus was wrong. The middle seat is here to stay. In late June, American Airlines announced that it would no longer block the middle seat on its planes or limit the capacity on its flights. Although blocking the seats was a relatively easy decision when demand was at its lowest, as customers have slowly begun to return, keeping a third of the seats on a given flight free was not possible for the airline without adding more flights or using larger, more expensive planes. American is not the only carrier filling its flights. United will sell every seat on board, and has argued that social distancing is not possible on planes. Spirit, Frontier, and other low-cost-carriers have also continued to fill their planes. Delta, however, has said it will cap flights at until at least the Sept. 30, blocking middle seats in economy and every other seat in first class. The airline has also said it will add additional flights to routes where demand outpaces the limited capacity. Airlines and industry representatives, including the International Air Transport Association, have argued that social distancing on flights is not necessary, due to air flow patterns on planes, High Efficiency Particulate Air filters that prevent microbes in the air from recirculating, other cleaning measures, and the use of masks. American Airlines, United, and others said they were taking other safety measures to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission. Those measures include mandatory masks on board, newly implemented cleaning and disinfection procedures, and requiring passengers to complete a health self-assessment before flights. Although American was called out by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Dr. Anthony Fauci for filling planes, others defended the action. United Chief Communications Officer Josh Earnest said this week that ""when it comes to blocking middle seats, that's a PR strategy. That's not a safety strategy."" Earnest added that even if a middle seat was blocked, it's simply impossible to provide the recommended six feet of social distance on a plane. ""When you're on board the aircraft, if you're sitting in the aisle, and the middle seat is empty, the person across the aisle from you is within six feet of you,"" he said. ""The person at the window is within six feet of you. The people in the row in front of you are within six feet of you. The people in the row behind you are within six feet of you. ""If you want to stay safe on the airplane, we need to wear a mask, we need to have good air filtration, the airplane needs to be thoroughly cleaned, and we need to make sure that every stage of your journey where we can socially distance, that we're doing that. Those are all the steps that scientists have recommended that we take."" So far, no outbreak or localized hotspots of COVID-19 have been traced back to a particular flight, although there has been limited scientific analysis of air travel. Regardless, as these other measures â€?particularly mandatory masks â€?become commonplace, and as middle seats are opened back up, we'll be able to tell more definitively whether they're effective at preventing the transmission of COVID-19 on flights. Then, we can embrace that one slight return to normal: the knowledge that despite hopes of more privacy or room to sprawl among those of us who don't want to empty their bank accounts for a plane ticket, the middle seat is here to stay.

American Airlines announced in early December that its long-running CEO Doug Parker is stepping down after 20 years at the helm. American Airlines CEO Doug Parker stepping down from 'truly the best job in our industry' During Parker's two-decade tenure, he consolidated a number of carriers into American through mergers to create the largest airline in the world.

American's journey started in 1921 with the founding of Robertson Aircraft, a general flying service and manufacturing company. In 1926, the company operated its first-ever flight between St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois.

The flight is considered the first regularly scheduled service of what would become American Airlines. Source: Britannica, FAA The same year, charter company Colonial Air Transport, formerly known as Bee Line, started carrying mail between New York and Boston. Source: Britannica, FAA The companies were independent, but, in 1929, the two merged to create the holding company, Aviation Corporation. This was the first union that would eventually establish American Airlines, which consists of some 85 merged companies today. Source: Britannica Aviation Corporation was reorganized as an operator and renamed American Airways in 1930 after new laws and reduction of mail routes forced companies to rethink their business models. Source: Britannica Finally, in 1934, the company became American Airlines after reworking its routes into a connected system. Cyrus Rowlett Smith, better known as C.R. Smith, was named CEO of American that same year. Source: Britannica After eight years of shuttling mail, American began to invest in passenger service. Smith worked with aircraft manufacturer Donald Douglas to develop the DC-3 passenger plane that would change the course of airline history. Source: American Airlines The DC-3 was built to carry passengers and make air travel profitable for carriers without relying on government subsidies. The first version was the Douglas Sleeper Transport, also known as Skysleepers, which was delivered to American in 1936. Source: Boeing The luxurious plane had 14 comfortable seats and four compartments that could convert into seven berths, with seven additional beds that folded down from the cabin ceiling.

The company was also the launch customer for the standard 21-seater DC-3, which came shortly after the Skysleeper. Source: Boeing In the mid-1940s, American took interest in overseas operations. The company acquired American Export Airlines (AEA) in 1945, which already had transatlantic rights to fly across the pond to northern Europe â€?a market dominated at the time by Pan Am. Source: The Dallas Morning News The international service started with Vought-Sikorsky VS-44 flying boats on routes between New York and cities like Shannon, Copenhagen, Berlin, Oslo, and Helsinki. Source: Airline Timetable Images AEA was renamed American Overseas Airlines (AOA) in 1945 and launched its first flight from New York to London Heathrow via Boston; Gander, Newfoundland; and Shannon, Ireland, using a DC-4 named Flagship New England. Source: The Dallas Morning News However, unsatisfied with its performance, American sold AOA to Pan Am in 1950 and abandoned its London route, not returning to the city until 1982. Source: The Dallas Morning News In 1953, American pioneered transcontinental travel using the DC-7 between New York and Los Angeles. It was the first airliner to operate the route in both directions. Source: American Airlines In addition to the DC-3, American also had a hand in developing the DC-10 trijet. The company wanted a widebody plane that was smaller than the mammoth Boeing 747 but could still operate long-haul routes to airports with shorter runways. Source: American Airlines, Airways Magazine American called on McDonnell Douglas in 1966 to produce the plane and placed an order for 25 of the new jet in 1968. Source: Airways Magazine The DC-10 took its maiden flight in 1970 and first entered commercial service with American in 1971 on a roundtrip flight between Los Angeles and Chicago. Source: Airways Magazine In the 1970s, American started expanding, growing from a smaller US carrier to a large international player. In January of that year, the airline acquired Trans Caribbean Airways, gaining routes to places like San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Port au Prince, Haiti. Source: The New York Times In 1981, American West Airlines, which would become part of American's history, commenced operations out of its base in Tempe, Arizona. The carrier was led by Doug Parker and eventually acquired US Airways in 2005 but kept the US Airways brand.

In 1982, the carrier opened a base at Chicago O'Hare International Airport and returned to London with daily nonstop flights from Dallas/Fort Worth to Gatwick.

Today, the airline has three wholly-owned subsidiaries, including Envoy Air, Piedmont Airlines, and PSA Airlines. Source: American Airlines The carrier also delegates its regional flying to other contracted carriers, including Republic Airways, Mesa Airlines, and SkyWest Airlines.

In 1986, the carrier announced it would buy AirCal, a California-based carrier, for $225 million. Source: Los Angeles Times This gave American the West Coast routes needed to expand into a nationwide airline and made it a strong competitor in the lucrative Los Angeles-San Francisco flight corridor. Source: Los Angeles Times Shortly after, in 1990, American bought routes to Central and South America from defunct US-based Eastern Air Lines. The deal made American a dominant competitor in the region and helped it open its huge hub at Miami International Airport. Source: American Airlines Continuing eastward, American bought three Trans World Airlines routes to London Heathrow in 1991 for $445 million. This was the first time the carrier flew to Heathrow since the 1940s.

However, it sold most of Reno Air's planes and eventually abandoned most of its Reno airport routes.

The demand comes during a growing controversy over the use of medication given to halt the development of puberty and secondary sex characteristics in children as young as 8 who have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Transgender issues and treatments have increasingly become part of a national debate in America. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said he is investigating whether pharmaceutical companies are promoting hormone therapies such as Supprelin LA and Lupron to children and their parents without disclosing potential long-term effects. ""I will not allow Big Pharma to misleadingly promote these drugs that may pose a high risk of serious physical and psychological damage to Texas children who cannot yet fathom or consent to the potential long-term effects of such use,"" Paxton said in a statement. ""Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc manufactures and markets Supprelin LA for the treatment of children with central precocious puberty. The Company does not promote its medications for off-label uses. That said, we intend to cooperate with this investigation,"" a spokeswoman for Endo said. Representatives for Abbvie could not be reached for comment by Reuters on Thursday. Paxton said that the medications Supprelin LA, which is manufactured by Endo, and Lupron Depot, made by Abbvie, were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for other medical conditions but were being used to halt puberty in children with gender dysphoria. In a related development, Arizona and Oklahoma on Thursday passed legislation that would ban transgender children born as boys from participating in girls' sports. Those bills were approved after Lia Thomas, a transgender swimmer for the University of Pennsylvania who was born male, won the women's Division 1 NCAA championship in the 500-yard freestyle race.

Pharmaceutical CEOs took aim at new drug-pricing proposals that would allow the government to negotiate prices for some medications, telling investors that the suggested changes would be ""chilling"" or ""detrimental"" to the development of new therapies.
The proposal would allow the federal government to negotiate prices for some therapies covered by Medicare Part B and D as well as for drugs that have been on the market for 9 or 13 years, depending if they are small-molecule therapies or biologics.
""As a company that invests heavily in R&D, we can tell you that the type of legislation that was proposed by the Senate Finance Committee with Medicare price setting will have a chilling effect on innovation that will translate into  new medicines for patients,"" Johnson & Johnson JNJ CEO Joaquin Duato said July 19, according to a FactSet transcript of the company's earnings call.
The CEOs at AbbVie Inc. ABBV, Bristol Myers Squibb Co. BMY, and J&J separately said elements of the proposal are ""detrimental,"" while leadership at Bristol, J&J, Merck & Co. MRK, and Pfizer Inc. PFE all referred to the negotiation proposal as ""price-setting."" Pharmaceutical companies say they support the cap on out-of-pocket costs for people covered by Medicare.","Pharmaceutical CEOs took aim at new drug-pricing proposals that would allow the government to negotiate prices for some medications, telling investors that the suggested changes would be ""chilling"" or ""detrimental"" to the development of new therapies. The Senate Finance Committee proposal, which is now included in the budget reconciliation bill that came out July 27, puts forward several changes expected to blunt soaring drug prices, an issue that has grabbed the attention of lawmakers and the American public over the past decade. The proposal would allow the federal government to negotiate prices for some therapies covered by Medicare Part B and D as well as for drugs that have been on the market for 9 or 13 years, depending if they are small-molecule therapies or biologics. It would require drug makers to provide rebates on drugs covered by Medicare and commercial health insurers that have prices that rise faster than inflation, and it would also put a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap on drugs covered by Part D, the prescription drug benefit. Making these changes is expected to yield more than $100 billion in savings for the federal healthcare system, while also reducing out-of-pocket spending on medication for seniors. But drug makers, which have long battled against restrictions on how they price their therapies, particularly in the lucrative U.S. market, say the proposed legislation would instead slow down their investment into research and development in some cases. ""As a company that invests heavily in R&D, we can tell you that the type of legislation that was proposed by the Senate Finance Committee with Medicare price setting will have a chilling effect on innovation that will translate into  new medicines for patients,"" Johnson & Johnson JNJ CEO Joaquin Duato said July 19, according to a FactSet transcript of the company's earnings call. There are similarities in the language used by pharmaceutical CEOs to describe their concerns about the proposed changes on earnings calls with investors over the last few weeks. The CEOs at AbbVie Inc. ABBV, Bristol Myers Squibb Co. BMY, and J&J separately said elements of the proposal are ""detrimental,"" while leadership at Bristol, J&J, Merck & Co. MRK, and Pfizer Inc. PFE all referred to the negotiation proposal as ""price-setting."" Pharmaceutical companies say they support the cap on out-of-pocket costs for people covered by Medicare. This makes sense. If patients can't afford the out-of-pocket costs for a therapy, they won't take it, and the companies won't earn revenue from those patients. It's the provision that has to do with negotiating prices based on the number of years a medication has been on the market that's causing the real concern. ""It's termed  negotiation but, in effect, what it is is price setting on drugs after a period of time,"" Merck CEO Robert Davis told investors last week. ""That will be highly chilling on future innovationâ€¦especially if you think about an area like oncology."" He cited Keytruda, a cancer therapy that first received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in 2014 and has since been granted an additional 30 or so indications. The drug is used to treat everything from melanoma to breast and lung cancers, and Davis said the company expects to double the number of indications between this year and 2028. To no surprise, Keytruda is Merck's top-selling therapy, generating $17.2 billion in sales in 2021. The implication is that knowing a government-decided price tag on a therapy like Keytruda is coming would stifle the company's interest in funding research into new indications the closer it gets to the 13-year window for biologics. ""By the time you got to the larger populations, you'd be within a year or two of when CMS could change the price,"" AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez said during a July 29 earnings call. ""So, one, it's impossible to figure out what the return's going to beâ€¦Two, it really puts negative pressure on you not to continue to develop new indications."" Some companies at high risk of being impacted by the legislation are AbbVie, AstraZeneca AZN, Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, and J&J â€?all of those manufacturers make cancer drugs, according to SVB Securities analyst David Risinger. Merck, however, isn't likely to take a hit because Keytruda is already preparing for biosimilar competition in 2028. ""Not only would the economics for many drugs be curtailed before loss of exclusivity, but innovators' willingness to develop new drugs, in particular small molecule therapies for seniors, would likely diminish,"" Risinger wrote in a July 29 investor note.

McKesson will pay $197 million, while AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal will each contribute $160.5 million to the settlement. Washington had opted out of a $26 billion nationwide opioid settlement involving the three largest U.S. drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson. The state previously said it would have received $417.9 million from McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen under that settlement. The settlement is one of the largest in Washington State history, state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a news conference. ""We could have joined the overwhelming majority of states and settled with the largest opioid distributors, but we chose to fight them in court instead,"" Ferguson said. ""That decision to take them to court will result in significant additional resources for Washington to combat the opioid epidemic."" The state had accused the three companies of failing to prevent prescription pills from being diverted for illegal use during a trial that began in November before King County Superior Court Judge Michael Scott in Seattle. Washington had sought $38.2 billion to fund public health initiatives related to opioid addiction. Despite falling far short of its trial demands, Washington improved on the previous settlement offer without risking a loss in court, Ferguson said. ""It would be a bad day for the state of Washington if I take that risk and I lose,"" Ferguson said. The settlement will become final if all Washington's political subdivisions agree to participate before a September 2022 deadline. If the settlement is finalized, the drug distributor payments will be spread over 17 years. The distributors, who deny wrongdoing, said the settlement would provide meaningful relief to communities impacted by the opioid epidemic in the United States, which has caused more than 500,000 overdose deaths over the past two decades, according government data. Washington state will continue to bring lawsuits against companies that contributed to the opioid crisis, Ferguson said. The state expects to go to trial against J&J in September. Other states that opted out of the broader nationwide settlement include Alabama and Oklahoma. West Virginia was not eligible to join the national agreement because of a prior settlement between the state and the three distributors.

Analog Devices,ADI,2022/8/8,"controversial products and services, human rights abuses and corporate complicity","Hottest Chip Maker Sees Cooling Ahead; Analog Devices' unique business model spared chip slowdown far, latest include warning sign
The chip maker's fiscal third-quarter results Wednesday morning set records, with revenue jumping 77% year over year to top $3 billion for the first time, and adjusted per-share earnings jumping 47% to a record of $2.52.
The results also exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, maintaining a strong track record in which ADI has only slightly missed analysts' quarterly top-line projections twice in the past five years, according to FactSet.

The company expounded further in its conference call, noting that orders ""moderated"" later in the July-ending quarter, with a ""modest increase in cancellations"" also taking place during the period.
And ADI specializes in high-end versions of those sorts of chips, targeting markets such as industrial and automotive where design wins can last over several years.
Texas Instrumentsâ€”ADI's closest competitor in analog chip-making that handles a much greater proportion of its production needs in-houseâ€”is expected to see its capex bill jump to 13% of revenue this year, compared with 6% two years ago.
ADI's ability to dance around that risk is a distinct advantage, but even the most nimble chip maker can't fully outmaneuver a recession.","You know the chip slowdown is getting bad when Analog Devices starts to feel it. That feeling is ever so slight at the moment. The chip maker's fiscal third-quarter results Wednesday morning set records, with revenue jumping 77% year over year to top $3 billion for the first time, and adjusted per-share earnings jumping 47% to a record of $2.52. The results also exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, maintaining a strong track record in which ADI has only slightly missed analysts' quarterly top-line projections twice in the past five years, according to FactSet.

The company expounded further in its conference call, noting that orders ""moderated"" later in the July-ending quarter, with a ""modest increase in cancellations"" also taking place during the period. That resulted in a cautious outlook. ADI's projected revenue of $3.15 billion for the current quarter was only 1% above analysts' forecastsâ€”compared with the 5% beat it has averaged over the previous four quarters. That may still seem rather tame compared with other recent warnings by chip makers such as Micron and Nvidia. But ADI's unique business model and market exposure shelters it from some of the chip sector's more troubled end markets, such as PCs and smartphones. Analog processors are designed for an array of uses, such as power management and thermal control. And ADI specializes in high-end versions of those sorts of chips, targeting markets such as industrial and automotive where design wins can last over several years. These also happen to be the markets where chip supply has been most constrained, as such processors that are typically made on older, depreciated production tools that have become in awfully short supply. Thus, investors have largely spared ADI as they have fled the rest of the chip sector on worries that the slowing global economy will finally cool chip demand. Ahead of Wednesday's report, ADI was the only large-cap stock on the PHLX Semiconductor Index still positive for the year. This gave the company's cautious tone extra weight. ADI's share price slid nearly 6% Wednesday morning and helped spark a fresh selloff across the sector: The PHLX index was down 3% by midday compared with a decline of less than 1% for the S&P 500. ADI will still likely keep an elevated position relative to its peers. The company noted Wednesday that its order backlog is still growing. And it employs a unique manufacturing model, where it splits between using its own production facilities and outsourcing but retains the ability to quickly pull outside production work back in-house to keep its own facilities fully used. That also keeps capital spending in check. ADI's capex for the current fiscal year is projected to amount to 6% of revenue, compared with 3% two years ago. Texas Instrumentsâ€”ADI's closest competitor in analog chip-making that handles a much greater proportion of its production needs in-houseâ€”is expected to see its capex bill jump to 13% of revenue this year, compared with 6% two years ago. TI is hardly the only chip maker expanding production. The shortage of the last two years has spurred a step-up in investments, fueled further by the recently signed Chips Act that will provide subsidies for expansion of domestic chip-making capacity. But new chip plants take years to complete, so new ones run the risk of coming online right when global demand coolsâ€”resulting in expensive facilities being underused. ADI's ability to dance around that risk is a distinct advantage, but even the most nimble chip maker can't fully outmaneuver a recession.

But MagSafe uses a series of magnets to precisely align the coils, allowing them to perfectly match every time and charge at a higher wattage (up to 15 watts, depending on the phone and charger) than other wireless charging tech.
Thanks to the series of magnets around the charging coil in the back of your iPhone, MagSafe accessories like chargers automatically snap into perfect alignment, so the system works automatically.
While the MagSafe charger is able to charge recent iPhones starting with the iPhone 8, it is only optimized for models that feature the magnetic charging coil on the back of the phone, which include the iPhone 12 and later models.
MagSafe solves that problem by ensuring the phone and charger perfectly align with the array of magnets that surround the charging coil.","* MagSafe is a wireless charging technology found in recent iPhone models starting with the iPhone 12. * It uses magnets to ensure the charger and phone perfectly align for a top charging speed of 15 watts. * MagSafe only magnetically connects to MagSafe accessories, so other devices won't snap to the back of your iPhone. Apple introduced MagSafe in October 2020, promising fast and convenient wireless charging that was a better alternative to ubiquitous Qi charging systems. Here is everything you need to know about MagSafe. What is a MagSafe charger? MagSafe is a wireless charging technology that Apple debuted with the iPhone 12, and it's directly compatible with the iPhone 12 series and subsequent iPhone models. It's a form of induction charging that can deliver fast 15 watt charging, about twice that of phones with traditional Qi wireless charging. Like Qi, MagSafe uses inductive charging â€?coils on both the charger and phone line up and transfer electrical energy wirelessly over very short distances. But MagSafe uses a series of magnets to precisely align the coils, allowing them to perfectly match every time and charge at a higher wattage (up to 15 watts, depending on the phone and charger) than other wireless charging tech. The magnets have other applications as well â€?you can easily affix MagSafe accessories to your iPhone, such as cases and wallets, which stay firmly attached to the phone via the MagSafe magnets. How does a MagSafe charger work? Thanks to the series of magnets around the charging coil in the back of your iPhone, MagSafe accessories like chargers automatically snap into perfect alignment, so the system works automatically. Apple designed the MagSafe charger standard so that only certified MagSafe chargers and accessories will magnetically attach to the MagSafe surface on the back of an iPhone, so other kinds of magnetic devices won't get attracted to or stuck to your phone. While the MagSafe charger is able to charge recent iPhones starting with the iPhone 8, it is only optimized for models that feature the magnetic charging coil on the back of the phone, which include the iPhone 12 and later models. For best results, you should always plug your MagSafe charger into its power source before connecting it to the iPhone. This allows the two devices to ""negotiate"" their connection and set the charging wattage properly. If you ever connect the iPhone to a MagSafe charger that's unplugged, separate the devices, plug in the charger, and then rejoin them. This way your phone is guaranteed to charge at top speed. What's the difference between wireless charging and MagSafe? Wireless charging using the Qi standard built into iPhones, Android, and other devices has been around for years. Although convenient, it's highly inefficient. There's no way to know how well you've aligned the phone and charger, but you only get the maximum charging speed when they are perfectly aligned â€?even slightly off, and you'll charge at a fraction of the top speed. MagSafe solves that problem by ensuring the phone and charger perfectly align with the array of magnets that surround the charging coil. MagSafe iPhones can still be charged with ordinary Qi chargers, though they perform better with a MagSafe charger.

The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), which represents over 3,000 pilots at the Seattle-based carrier, said 99% of those who cast their ballots backed strike-authorization. Alaska pilots, however, cannot walk off the job until the National Mediation Board grants them permission. The board will first have to determine that both the parties are at an impasse and further bargaining would not be productive. This lengthy and complex process makes it rather difficult for airline workers to strike. The last pilot strike at a U.S. passenger carrier was at Spirit Airlines in 2010. Alaska said the vote would not impact its customers and operation as its pilots are not on strike. ""We remain committed to reaching a deal to provide an updated contract that is good for Alaska's pilots,"" the company said. The vote, however, highlights growing labor tension in the U.S. airline industry. Almost all the major carriers are facing protests from their pilots, who are demanding higher pay and improvements in ""fatiguing"" schedules in their new contracts. United Airlines is the only major carrier that has reached an agreement with its pilots on new contract. The protests come at a time when the industry is grappling with staffing shortages after letting go thousands of pilots at the height of the coronavirus pandemic. Alaska itself is battling a high attrition rate. In the first quarter, 27 of its pilots resigned prior to their mandated retirement date. ALPA says the company is on track to lose 180 pilots this year to other carriers, as its pilot contract remains below the rest of the industry. Staffing woes are also taking a toll on Alaska's operations, forcing it to cancel 4% of its flights this month. Alaska Air and its pilots have been negotiating a new contract since the summer of 2019. ALPA has said the company has not ""meaningfully"" addressed its concerns related to job security and schedule flexibility.

Allstate's car-insurance business had a strong quarter as rush-hour fender-benders were below normal, with many Americans still working from home rather than commuting.
MetLife's net income fell 93% to $290 million, a decline primarily related to mark-to-market losses on the financial hedges it buys to protect the company from falling interest rates and stock markets.

Allstate's car-insurance business had a strong quarter as rush-hour fender-benders were below normal, with many Americans still working from home rather than commuting. MetLife had sharply higher death benefits on life-insurance policies while payouts on pension products and other annuities were reduced. ""We believe the worst impact of the pandemic on our business performance is behind us,"" MetLife Chief Executive Michel Khalaf said. Share Your Thoughts What was your big takeaway from MetLife's and Allstate's quarterly reports? Join the conversation below. The pandemic's impact on the insurance industry hasn't been as bad as was feared when Covid-19 cases started climbing just over a year ago. Car insurers got windfall profits as stay-at-home directives and business shutdowns left vehicles parked for days. While death claims are elevated, U.S. life insurers have paid fewer claims than initially expected per 100,000 Covid-19 fatalities, largely because the virus has disproportionately killed the elderly and other people with little or no insurance. MetLife's net income fell 93% to $290 million, a decline primarily related to mark-to-market losses on the financial hedges it buys to protect the company from falling interest rates and stock markets. When rates and equities rise, as they did in the first quarter, the value of that protection falls. Still, MetLife's reported results got a lift from improved market conditions. Wall Street analysts largely look past those swings and focus on adjusted earnings, which strip out items considered nonrecurring. On that basis, MetLife reported a 36% surge to $1.97 billion. Much of the improvement came from unusually strong returns from private-equity holdings in the company's huge investment portfolio. It has a tiny percentage of such holdings, but they helped fuel a 74% gain from the year-earlier period to $5.31 billion in net investment income. Allstate posted a net loss of $1.41 billion, a reversal from net income of $513 million a year earlier. The results reflected an aggregate net loss of about $4 billion in the quarter from previously announced agreements to sell a pair of life and annuity insurers. Allstate's adjusted net income rose 56% to $1.87 billion. The improvement came even as catastrophe losses more than doubled, to $590 million from $211 million. A big part of the improvement came from the auto-insurance business, thanks to ""decreased accident frequency and a lower expense ratio,"" the company said. Miles driven across the U.S. ""is headed up to pre-pandemic levels, but not always at the same time of day"" as people used to drive, Allstate Chief Executive Tom Wilson said in an interview. ""It looks like we are coming out of the reduction in auto accidents slowly, but nobody knows where it is going"" as Americans return to their workplaces. ""You could surmise that as the country gets back to work, it will go back up."" Allstate, which is one of the nation's biggest home insurers, was among property insurers hit with large claims volume from the stretch of frigid February weather in Texas and other states. The unusual weather across Southern states caused widespread freezing and burst pipes, leading to extensive water damage. Industrywide, property insurers face an estimated $18 billion bill for the cold-weather damage to homes and businesses, the equivalent cost of a major hurricane, according to a risk-modeling firm, Karen Clark & Co. Like its rival Prudential Financial Inc., MetLife experienced higher costs in this year's first quarter, compared with the year before, in its business of selling life insurance to employers' benefits programs. Both Prudential and MetLife have large retirement-income businesses that have benefited as pensioners and owners of annuities have died prematurely, the companies' results show. Prudential reported its first-quarter results Tuesday. It said its group-insurance business lost $132 million in the first quarter on an adjusted basis, compared with operating profit of $44 million a year earlier, a decline largely driven by Covid-19 deaths. Its retirement-income business reported adjusted profit of $623 million, up from $245 million, ""including favorable impacts due to Covid-19."" Separately, MetLife this week filed a legal response to a U.S. Department of Labor investigation into its handling of the carrier's previously acknowledged failure to properly search for thousands of workers who were owed money as part of its ""pension risk-transfer"" business. MetLife publicly revealed the failure in 2017 and reached settlements with the New York Department of Financial Services, the Massachusetts Securities Division and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It agreed on ways to search for and compensate, with interest, the missing pensioners. In its filing in federal court in Manhattan, MetLife maintained that the information sought by the Labor Department in a January subpoena ""is outside the DOL's jurisdiction"" because group annuitiesâ€”the product used to pay the pensionsâ€”are state-regulated. The department's court filings state that it is investigating whether MetLife violated any provisions of federal law.

The deal has also attracted attention from other regulators. The U.K.'s Competition and Markets Authority has said it is looking into the planned acquisition. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has been seeking information about the deal from the companies, citing a previous regulatory filing. Broadcom said it looked forward to continuing to work with European regulators as part of their review process. ""The combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice,"" a Broadcom spokesman said. ""We are confident that regulators will see this when they conclude their review."" VMware said the deal would offer the companies' combined customers more choice and flexibility. The EU said in a statement on Tuesday that its preliminary examination of the deal prompted concerns about hardware components such as network interface cards and storage adapters. For example, Broadcom could make it harder for VMware's software to interoperate with competitors' hardware, the commission said. It said the company could also shut out competitors by preventing them from using VMware's software or making it harder for them to access it. ""This, in turn, could lead to higher prices, lower quality and less innovation for business customers, and ultimately consumers,"" the commission said. The commission said it would also look into whether Broadcom could hinder the development of smart network interface cards by other providers or start bundling its software with VMware's software in a way that limits customer choice. The European Commission will have until May to make a decision on the merger. The deal to buy VMware would further Broadcom's push into software, nearly tripling the size of the company's software division.

The survey found that a majority of millennials are homeowners (53%, up from 52% in 2021), and 67% are likely to buy a new home in the the next two years. ""The number one reason cited was an improving financial position, following the trend from the last few years of our survey,"" Bank of America analysts wrote.

But millennials aren't looking for something brand new. Instead, 80% say they prefer an older home in need of work in order to save money. More than three-quarters of those who already own a home say they started a renovation project in the first 12 months after making the purchase, ""meaning that the recent housing boom still has lasting benefits to renovation activity.""

""There's $700 trillion of financial assets in the world and Paxos, our big bet is that over time â€?it may take 20 years â€?but that all of those financial assets effectively will be replatformed on the blockchain,"" Hessert said.","Click here. * Paxos is a startup that lets other companies offer crypto products and services. * It has inked deals with Wall Street powerhouses from Bank of America to Mastercard. * The startup has raised $540 million and is valued at $2.4 billion. * This article is part of Rise of the Crypto Economy, a series that explores how crypto is reshaping and driving innovation in the global economy. Wall Street is finally turning a corner when it comes to crypto â€?and one startup that's established itself as a critical link between the two worlds is gearing up despite the crypto downturn. Paxos provides blockchain infrastructure for businesses to offer crypto features and services, from tokenization to buying, holding, and selling crypto. It's part of a new class of fintechs that has emerged to help traditional firms access the new world of infrastructure and offer crypto services to their customers. The startup has raised $540 million to date, is valued at $2.4 billion, and has established relationships with firms like Bank of America, Credit Suisse, and Mastercard. ""They come to us to be able to use our technology and our regulatory stack as both the technology, but also the licensing to be able to provide those services,"" Walter Hessert, Paxos' head of strategy, told Insider of its typical client. PayPal and its subsidiary Venmo both enable their users to buy, sell, and hold bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies by leveraging Paxos on the back-end. The same goes for LatAm fintechs Mercado Libre and Nubank. Paxos' partnerships are similar to that of challenger banks and its back-end banking partners. While you've likely heard of Chime, it's less likely you've come across The Bancorp Bank or Stride Bank. But they're the reason the online-only bank can offer debit cards and checking accounts without a national bank license. Just as neobanks need back-end banking partners that have the necessary regulatory approval and tech to offer financial products, traditional Wall Street firms need to pair up with a crypto partner to offer digital-asset features. Wall Street eases into crypto The boss of the nation's largest bank in JPMorgan could be one of the clearest signals of the industry's changing attitude toward digital assets and their underlying tech â€?and how nuanced it can be. JPMorgan CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon went from calling the asset class ""a fraud"" in 2017 to praising crypto's underlying technology, blockchain, just five years later in his 2022 annual shareholder letter. Indeed, finance incumbents, from Goldman Sachs to Citigroup, have begun to embrace the technology in the past year. And global venture funding into blockchain startups increased to $25.2 billion last year â€?a more than 700% jump between 2020 and 2021 â€?according to CB Insights. Another driver of Wall Street's embrace of crypto is ""that this is ultimately just another rail on which these assets can move â€?and there's a lot of complexities to holding and trading and moving digital assets or tokenizing non-digital assets into digital assets,"" Hessert added. For instance, Paxos' equities settlement service, used by Bank of America and Credit Suisse, enables faster processing because of its underpinning blockchain technology. Those firms are ""leveraging us to be able to turn cash and US stocks into tokenized forms for more transparent and closer to real-time settlement than what's available today,"" Hessert said. Looking ahead, Paxos is eyeing a bigger piece of the Wall Street pie when it comes to tokenizing assets. In 2019, Paxos expanded into gold-backed tokens with Pax Gold, and that's just the beginning. ""There's $700 trillion of financial assets in the world and Paxos, our big bet is that over time â€?it may take 20 years â€?but that all of those financial assets effectively will be replatformed on the blockchain,"" Hessert said. Other prime candidates include getting into FX markets via the rise of tokenized fiat currencies, real estate, and digital types of properties, like non-fungible tokens, he added. And while the bear market has put downward pressure on the crypto industry, it's not Paxos' first rodeo. The fintech has been around since 2012 and endured the crypto winter in 2018. The current downturn has seen ""ebbs and flows of interest and motivation to integrate these solutions,"" Hessert said. But the company views the accelerated integration of crypto and blockchain in the last two to three years as offsetting the current pullback, he added. ""There's definitely a different sentiment in the retail crypto market than there was two months ago,"" Hessert said, but having Paxos' core product focused on the infrastructure layer between institutions has helped insulate the company somewhat from cryptocurrency trading volatility. ""Just because there is a sharp crash in the price of the underlying asset doesn't mean it's any less of an exciting or important technology that's being adopted,"" Hessert said.

The S&P 500's ability to rally off of support at 3,900 last week bodes well for continued upside in the stock market as investor sentiment remains depressed, according to Bank of America.
Aiding bulls potential for a continued rally in stocks is the fact that sentiment indicators continue to show an overwhelmingly sour mood towards stocks among investors, and that has reliably served as a bullish contrarian indicator for the market.

The S&P 500's ability to rally off of support at 3,900 last week bodes well for continued upside in the stock market as investor sentiment remains depressed, according to Bank of America. "" S&P 500 rallied after support at 3,900 bent but did not break,"" Bank of America technical research strategist Stephen Suttmeier said in a Monday note. After reclaiming its 50-day moving average on Friday, the next stop for the S&P 500 in the short-term is as high as 4,219, according to Suttmeier. A rally to that level represents potential upside of 3% from current levels and coincides with a downside gap seen during the mid-August decline in stocks. A continued rally to just above 4,200 in the S&P 500 would also put the index within striking distance of its falling 200-day moving average, a level that served as key resistance on August 16. Aiding bulls potential for a continued rally in stocks is the fact that sentiment indicators continue to show an overwhelmingly sour mood towards stocks among investors, and that has reliably served as a bullish contrarian indicator for the market. ""BofA Bull & Bear indicator back to zero... extreme bear sentiment remains  most bullish factor for credit and stocks,"" BofA's Michael Hartnett said in a Friday note. It's not just BofA's sentiment indicator that is seeing a lot of bearish sentiment among investors. Last week's AAII weekly sentiment survey revealed just 18% of its survey respondents were optimistic about the stock market over the next six months, representing its lowest level since late-April. Meanwhile, 53% of respondents were bearish on the market, representing a big jump from last month's reading of just 37%, and well above historical averages of 30%. That bearish sentiment could turnaround quickly and lead to renewed buying pressure if the stock market rally continues to broaden and see increased participation among different sectors. Aiding Suttmeier's short-term bullish view on stocks is that the recent rally was ""confirmed by breadth."" Upside participation in the recent rally was so strong that it generated an upward thrust from oversold levels for the percentage of S&P 500 stocks trading above its 10-day moving average. ""One positive is that prior oversold levels for this tactical breadth indicators occurred as the SPX moved to lower lows, while the late August into September oversold happened with the SPX at a potential higher low,"" Suttmeier said.

â€œWe started tracking â€? found that at least half of our biggest clients have signed up to the alliance,â€?says Carolyn Weinberg, global head of product of the iShares and Index Investments business at BlackRock.
Decarbonization as a new focus With net-zero public commitments by asset owners and institutions, Weinberg says many of their clients are focused on decarbonization.
The ESG version of the two new funds are part of a long-term trend to offer sustainable versions of core products and their net-zero goals, as described in Finkâ€™s 2020  and 2021 letters to clients.
The new funds bring the total number of globally available iShares sustainable ETFs to more than 150, with $149.1 billion in assets.
For the bond fund, Weinberg says the new methodology increases the overall credit quality slightly while lowering the weighted average carbon intensity by 67%.
Weinberg says BlackRock initially launched a version the equity fund in Europe, with demand coming from global institutions and model portfolio builders, before launching in the U.S. For both of the funds, they are expecting more demand from firms that build asset allocation models and other model portfolio builders, such as those used by robo-advisers, registered investment advisers and home offices.
Weinberg says that, in the case for fixed income, â€œcertainly yield is challenging.â€?But a fund like the ESG corporate bond fund remains a â€œbuilding blockâ€?to supplement existing fixed income holdings and a way to â€œcustomize the outcome of the portfolio from the decarbonization.â€?Debbie Carlson is a MarketWatch columnist.","â€œAt least half of our biggest clients have signed upâ€?to the UN NetZero Alliance, a BlackRock executive says At least half of BlackRockâ€™s biggest clients have signed the UN NetZero Alliance or have made some kind of public commitment to sustainability and reduction of their carbon emissions. The NetZero Alliance is a consortium of asset owners that have committed to transition their investment portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Most of BlackRockâ€™s clients are organizations such as institutions, pension funds and college endowments. BlackRock, the worldâ€™s largest asset manager, with $9.46 trillion in assets under management, has made ESG investing a focal point for its strategy. CEO Larry Fink said earlier this year there has been a â€œtectonic shiftâ€?in investors wanting to invest in sustainability-focused companies. â€œWe started tracking â€? found that at least half of our biggest clients have signed up to the alliance,â€?says Carolyn Weinberg, global head of product of the iShares and Index Investments business at BlackRock. Those clients are looking for investment products to help achieve some of these commitments, Weinberg adds. She declined to specify the number of clients that have signed the alliance. As of Nov. 5, the asset manager said its iShares division had $3.04 trillion in assets and a global lineup of more than 900 exchange traded funds. Weinberg says environmental, social and governance investing has been popular in Europe for a while, but until a few years ago, it was still a niche style in the U.S. It was also more values-based with less focus on performance. Now ESG is part of every conversation she has with U.S. clients. There are a few reasons for that. â€œEven if you do not believe in climate change, you have to know whatâ€™s going on and why,â€?she says. The second reason is performance. Weinberg says that, since Covidâ€™s impact on markets, the companyâ€™s ESG indexes outperformed their parent benchmarks. BlackRockâ€™s data specifically pointed to ESG scores for the gains. She says looking back to the first quarter, 94% of its ESG indexes outperformed their parent benchmarks, and 70% of that outperformance stemmed from the ESG scores. â€œThat means that ESG scores are consequential to returns. The whole mindset has really impacted this mainstreaming of sustainable investing,â€?she says. Morningstarâ€™s research also shows that sustainable funds outperform traditional peers. Decarbonization as a new focus With net-zero public commitments by asset owners and institutions, Weinberg says many of their clients are focused on decarbonization. Thatâ€™s led to the recent spate of new climate-focused ETFs this year. On Wednesday, iShares ESG Advanced Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETFELQD debuted with $20 million in assets, an ESG version of the $39 billion iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETFLQD. Last week the firm launched iShares ESG MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Factor ETF ESMV, with $5 million in assets, an ESG version of the $29 billion iShares MSCI USA Min Vol Factor ETFUSMV. In April, BlackRock launched two carbon-transition ETFs in conjunction with the California State Teachersâ€?Retirement System (CalSTRS) and other pension and insurance fund backers: the BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETFLCTU and the BlackRock World ex U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETFLCTD. Together the funds have more than $2 billion in assets. The ESG version of the two new funds are part of a long-term trend to offer sustainable versions of core products and their net-zero goals, as described in Finkâ€™s 2020  and 2021 letters to clients. The new funds bring the total number of globally available iShares sustainable ETFs to more than 150, with $149.1 billion in assets. The firm says in 2020 sustainable ETFs saw $47 billion in net inflows. The two new funds exclude certain businesses such as tobacco, controversial weapons, thermal coal and other restrictions. For the minimum volatility factor, the methodology seeks at least a 20% improvement in its weighted-average, industry-adjusted ESG Score relative to the parent index at each rebalancing and a 30% reduction in carbon at each rebalancing. For the bond fund, Weinberg says the new methodology increases the overall credit quality slightly while lowering the weighted average carbon intensity by 67%. Where demand is strongest The launch of these two new ETFs comes at a time when both the minimum volatility and corporate bond funds have seen outflows year-to-date, according to ETF Research Center. Weinberg says BlackRock initially launched a version the equity fund in Europe, with demand coming from global institutions and model portfolio builders, before launching in the U.S. For both of the funds, they are expecting more demand from firms that build asset allocation models and other model portfolio builders, such as those used by robo-advisers, registered investment advisers and home offices.

Today, Mr. Fink is telling CEOs that companies must prepare for a scaleback of fossil fuels, and that the private sector should work with governments to do so.
Mr. Fink's power, combined with his advocacy on a hot-button issue, has made him a flashpoint for activists, politicians and unions, both those who think BlackRock isn't doing enough and others who say it's doing too much.
Five Democratic senators wrote to Mr. Fink in 2020 saying BlackRock needed to support more shareholder resolutions to match his promises.

I do."" Mr. Fink says companies that embrace their responsibilities in crises can fulfill a role in society while delivering returns to shareholders.
U.S. government officials have called on Mr. Fink to help them cope with crisesâ€”the pandemic-rattled financial markets in March 2020, and, a dozen years earlier, market dangers posed by the failing bank Bear Stearns.
On a Sunday, New York Fed President Tim Geithner and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson asked Mr. Fink for help as they scrambled to forestall a messy collapse of Bear Stearns, desperate to find a solution before Asian markets opened in a few hours.
Geithner and Paulson asked Mr. Fink: If the Fed provided financing for a newly formed company that would absorb Bear's bad assets, was there a reasonable chance the collateral could cover the loan?
""No one understood the market better, and BlackRock was not teetering on the brink."" Roughly a year later, Mr. Fink got a chance for BlackRock to acquire Barclays PLC's money-management business.
When it was time to proof an annual letter on how BlackRock approached its duties as a shareholder, Mr. Fink initially refused to sign it.
Now that BlackRock reached across the entire market, Mr. Fink decided the firm needed to be a counterweight to activist investors who target companies looking to make a quick buck.
BlackRock in 2012 released the first of Mr. Fink's annual letters to CEOs, which have become required reading for many chief executives.
His back feels the toll from years of desk work, said Mr. Fink, who is 69.
BlackRock's board and executives, as part of discussions on succession planning, recently asked Mr. Fink to continue as CEO.
When Fidelity Investments in 2018 shook the money-management business by offering zero-fee index funds, Mr. Fink called a meeting and told his teams to pick up the phone and put BlackRock's name in front of clients.
""Trillions,"" Mr. Fink said.
Mr. Fink said he understands why BlackRock's role was controversial.
When company executives phone to cajole, persuade or threaten BlackRock on how it should handle proxy votes on executive pay or climate proposals, Mr. Fink hands them off to a BlackRock group that interacts with companies.
in a referendum that revealed discontent with the oil company's climate strategy, and oppose an executive-pay package at AT&TInc. In 2017, Mr. Fink was part of a group of CEOs serving as a sounding board for former President Trump on business policies.
With its index funds, BlackRock is locked into investing in all kinds of companies, from coal miners to wind farms, In portfolios run by active managers, the firm has scaled back thermal coal exposure, as it pledged to, and said last year it would flag companies that posed significant climate risk for potential selling.
In the lead-up to the Glasgow climate summit, Mr. Fink asked other finance CEOs to press government leaders to create incentives for investors to fund alternative-energy sources.
""Society is trying in certain instances to pressure companies to do more, including at times what ought to be the role of government,"" said Evan Greenberg, the CEO of insurance company Chubb Ltd., who has gone fly-fishing with Mr. Fink.","Few private citizens wield more power in America today than Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock Inc. In pushing companies to embrace climate-friendly policies, that has made him a lightning rod. The firm he runs manages some $10 trillion for pension funds, endowments, governments, companies and individuals, equal to more than 10% of the world's gross domestic product in 2020. Its funds are among the three largest shareholders in more than 80% of the companies in the S&P 500. As steward for millions of investors, BlackRock wields vast shareholder voting power, which it uses either to back managements or to prod them in new directions. Today, Mr. Fink is telling CEOs that companies must prepare for a scaleback of fossil fuels, and that the private sector should work with governments to do so. He warns of the disruption climate change could cause both the economy and financial markets, but sees historic investment opportunity in the energy shift. It's a point he has made to conferences in Davos, Venice, Riyadh and Glasgow over the past year. ""This is the beginning of a long but rapidly accelerating transitionâ€”one that will unfold over many years and reshape asset prices of every type,"" he said in a letter to CEOs last year. Mr. Fink's power, combined with his advocacy on a hot-button issue, has made him a flashpoint for activists, politicians and unions, both those who think BlackRock isn't doing enough and others who say it's doing too much. Five Democratic senators wrote to Mr. Fink in 2020 saying BlackRock needed to support more shareholder resolutions to match his promises. In France that year, activists stormed BlackRock offices, flung papers and paint and scrawled ""GREENWASHING"" above a desk. Tariq Fancy, a former BlackRock executive who runs an educational nonprofit, said Mr. Fink's message is distracting people from more-dramatic measures Mr. Fancy argues are necessary, such as carbon taxes. ""It's like giving wheatgrass to a cancer patient,"" he said. ""The false promise of this wheatgrass serves to delay the onset of the more painful, yet necessary, solutions."" Hanging over the discussion is the argument that Mr. Fink is taking on a role better left to elected representatives. In mid-2021, two Republican senators wrote to a large 401(k)-type plan expressing concern BlackRock was putting its CEO's views ahead of investors' needs and infusing left-leaning priorities in its voting guidelines. Real-estate investor Sam Zell said to CNBC a few years ago: ""I didn't know Larry Fink had been made God."" Mr. Fink says BlackRock acts as a voice for its investors. Mr. Fink, who describes himself as a conservative Democrat, says he isn't being political when he says investors and businesses should work alongside the government to address broad problems. When companies play a role, he says, they reduce the need for governments to engage in deficit spending to tackle the issues. ""I believe in the power of American capitalism,"" Mr. Fink said. ""Progressives don't believe deficits matter. I do."" Mr. Fink says companies that embrace their responsibilities in crises can fulfill a role in society while delivering returns to shareholders. In an interview at his horse farm in Westchester County, north of New York City, he brought up an example from the previous century. ""See what Johnson & Johnson did in World War I and II,"" he said. ""You can call them opportunists by providing Band-Aids and gauzes and all that stuff to the military, but they were there during the crisis and stood there."" As for BlackRock, he says, it can help investors by offering funds focused on environmental, social, and governance-minded investing, plus software to gauge climate-related risks such as drought and floods. In 2020, he told CEOs BlackRock would be increasingly disposed to vote against boards and companies that don't report their climate risks in formats BlackRock endorses. Mr. Fink also presses companies to disclose more on the social effects of their business, such as the welfare of their workers or their local communities. To him, this is just good business; he says companies attentive to societal needs wind up protecting shareholder returns. Many of BlackRock's investors want the firm simply to track the markets through index funds, which it does in channeling money into economies from China to Argentina to Saudi Arabia. Mr. Fink's prominence partly reflects changes in finance, including a move away from active stockpickers and toward passive index funds. That in turn has shifted the dynamic in corporate boardrooms to give power to large asset managers such as BlackRock. U.S. government officials have called on Mr. Fink to help them cope with crisesâ€”the pandemic-rattled financial markets in March 2020, and, a dozen years earlier, market dangers posed by the failing bank Bear Stearns. ""Treasury Secretaries and finance ministers come and go,"" said David Rubenstein, the co-founder of the private-equity firm Carlyle Group Inc. ""They work for someone else who can fire them tomorrow and have to build what others want them to. When you are the CEO of the biggest asset manager, you don't have to do that."" Laurence Fink got his start on Wall Street at First Boston, where he ran a desk that pooled together mortgages and other loans and sold off pieces of the bundles. While investors snapped up safer tranches of this financial innovation, the riskiest parts stayed on the bank's balance sheet. When interest rates fell in 1986, his desk lost $100 million in the second quarter. Mr. Fink was forced to leave. He founded BlackRock two years later with the desk's head trader, Rob Kapito, and six others. A scrappy bond manager in its early days, BlackRock lured investors with the pitch that it had the same risk technology as big banks but without the conflicts they had when they used their own money to make bets on companies. In March 2008, BlackRock was drawn into Fed efforts to cope with the deflating housing bubble. On a Sunday, New York Fed President Tim Geithner and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson asked Mr. Fink for help as they scrambled to forestall a messy collapse of Bear Stearns, desperate to find a solution before Asian markets opened in a few hours. Mr. Fink raced from his farm to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York after getting Mr. Geithner's call that day. The officials wanted Bear to be absorbed by JPMorgan Chase & Co. but that bank worried about Bear's stash of rapidly souring mortgage assets. No one was sure what these were worth. Messrs. Geithner and Paulson asked Mr. Fink: If the Fed provided financing for a newly formed company that would absorb Bear's bad assets, was there a reasonable chance the collateral could cover the loan? Mr. Fink told them U.S. taxpayers wouldn't lose money over the long run. U.S. officials moved the radioactive assets into a limited-liability company financed by the Fed so JPMorgan could be comfortable taking over Bear, which it did. BlackRock helped select which assets went into the LLC portfolio and oversaw it for the government. That program ultimately delivered gains for taxpayers. ""Larry was perfect for this job,"" Mr. Paulson recalled. ""No one understood the market better, and BlackRock was not teetering on the brink."" Roughly a year later, Mr. Fink got a chance for BlackRock to acquire Barclays PLC's money-management business. BlackRock had considered buying the business in the past. Now he pressed for a deal. In June 2009, he celebrated the birth of his first grandchild. He held the baby, then headed to the office for an all-nighter to raise the final $3 billion needed to acquire Barclays Global Investors. The deal lifted BlackRock's assets under management to roughly $3 trillion and gave it an arsenal of index-mirroring funds with much lower fees than actively managed funds. It also gave Mr. Fink a megaphone. When it was time to proof an annual letter on how BlackRock approached its duties as a shareholder, Mr. Fink initially refused to sign it. He thought the letter didn't reflect his voice, and wanted one that did. Now that BlackRock reached across the entire market, Mr. Fink decided the firm needed to be a counterweight to activist investors who target companies looking to make a quick buck. ""There needed to be a louder voice for long-term investors,"" he said. BlackRock in 2012 released the first of Mr. Fink's annual letters to CEOs, which have become required reading for many chief executives. He uses the letters to prod, scold and push companies to disclose more about how they provide for workers, the environment and the community at large. The letters emerge from a monthslong writing process that involves debates by executives and occasional help from former Fed and Treasury speechwriters. ""Climate risk is investment risk,"" Mr. Fink has told readers. Also, ""Profits and purpose are inextricably linked."" Starting in 2019, his letters drew the attention of a Federal Trade Commission official, Bilal Sayyed, who showed some to colleagues at the antitrust agency and asked them to think about whether BlackRock was affecting competition in industries. The FTC later proposed a rule that a money manager must alert regulators when, across all of its funds, it oversees a certain size stake in a particular company. The proposal's fate is in limbo in the Biden administration. For much of his career, Mr. Fink was known for arriving at the office by 6 a.m., while traveling two weeks a month. He now starts his workday about 7:30 following a session with a trainer. His back feels the toll from years of desk work, said Mr. Fink, who is 69. BlackRock's board and executives, as part of discussions on succession planning, recently asked Mr. Fink to continue as CEO. He said he is planning to retire in no more than five years. As a CEO, he can be impatient, colleagues say, and hates to be beaten. When Fidelity Investments in 2018 shook the money-management business by offering zero-fee index funds, Mr. Fink called a meeting and told his teams to pick up the phone and put BlackRock's name in front of clients. ""Stop tripping over your dâ€”ks,"" he demanded, according to several people at the meeting. BlackRock fired back at Fidelity by cutting costs on several funds. On March 18, 2020, with the coronavirus spreading, stocks tumbling and bond trading seizing up, Mr. Fink got another summons to Washington. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin organized an Oval office meeting, hoping the conversation would make clear to then-President Donald Trump that a government response to the pandemic needed to be big. The president and officials debated what needed to be done and how. They discussed how much the government should spend to keep the economy afloat. ""Trillions,"" Mr. Fink said. In the next week, the government unveiled a roughly $2 trillion package, some of it to fund an emergency effort to prop up financial markets. A formal role for BlackRock wasn't discussed at the meeting, but soon the Fed hired a BlackRock unit to help it pump money into corporate bondsâ€”a first for the central bankâ€”and other markets. The markets stabilized, and bond ETFs gained the stamp of approval as a central bank tool. Part of BlackRock's assignment was helping the Fed buy bond exchange-traded funds, including BlackRock's own. In the rush to head off a deep recession, the Fed didn't bid out the job. it simply hired BlackRock. In April that year, three Democratic lawmakers urged the government to provide safeguards to avoid cementing BlackRock's importance to the economy through the firm's crisis work. Mr. Fink said he understands why BlackRock's role was controversial. The firm estimates it lost money on the work, given the resources and time consumed, said people familiar with the matter. It didn't charge fees on any ETFs in the portfolio it ran for the Fed and rebated fees from its own ETFs back to the Fed. Mr. Fink has cut back his travel during the pandemic but invites one or two CEOs each week to his Manhattan townhouse for dinner. He says they order take-out food and do the dishes afterward. He spends Thursday evenings to Sunday afternoons at his farm, where he has installed a desk in a barn filled with American folk art. There, he has planted some 400 American chestnut trees as well as apple trees, elms and maples through the years. Mr. Fink gets excited as he identifies each species. Through the day, the duck ringtone on his cellphone goes off. When company executives phone to cajole, persuade or threaten BlackRock on how it should handle proxy votes on executive pay or climate proposals, Mr. Fink hands them off to a BlackRock group that interacts with companies. Though he is in discussions on rules guiding the firm's votes, he removes himself from decisions on any one vote. ""I tell them factually that is not my job,"" he said. Among thousands of recent shareholder votes, BlackRock wielded ballots in ways that helped to shake up Toshiba Corp.'s board, elect three board members at Exxon Mobil Corp. in a referendum that revealed discontent with the oil company's climate strategy, and oppose an executive-pay package at AT&TInc. In 2017, Mr. Fink was part of a group of CEOs serving as a sounding board for former President Trump on business policies. After the racially motivated and violent clash in Charlottesville, Va., that year, Mr. Fink huddled with another member, PepsiCo Inc.'s then-CEO Indra Nooyi, over what both considered Mr. Trump's insufficient condemnation of those behind the violence, and the two decided to step down from the group. Some other CEOs arrived at the same position, leading the president to dissolve it. Share Your Thoughts Is Larry Fink's climate advocacy a proper role for an asset manager? Join the conversation below. Three former BlackRock employees have key positions in the Biden administration, including the firm's former head of sustainable investing. Mr. Fink says he has never raised money for any presidential candidate and has donated to both Republicans and Democrats over the years. BlackRock published a study in 2019 on how it said climate change and events related to it affect the municipal-bond market and how extreme weather threatens infrastructure. The firm forecast that 58% of U.S. metro areas would suffer gross domestic product losses of at least 1% over the next decades if they didn't prepare for climate risks. With its index funds, BlackRock is locked into investing in all kinds of companies, from coal miners to wind farms, In portfolios run by active managers, the firm has scaled back thermal coal exposure, as it pledged to, and said last year it would flag companies that posed significant climate risk for potential selling. Addressing a meeting in Venice of leaders from the Group of 20 nations last July, Mr. Fink urged ministers to create more private-public partnerships for renewable-technology investments. One idea he pushed was authorizing the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to shoulder the first losses on sustainable-energy projects, so other investors would feel safe putting in money. It was an echo of how the U.S. in 2008 fenced off the worst Bear Stearns holdings to encourage JPMorgan to take over the firm. In the lead-up to the Glasgow climate summit, Mr. Fink asked other finance CEOs to press government leaders to create incentives for investors to fund alternative-energy sources. He urged other executives to drop calls for carbon taxes, saying their cost would trigger a backlash, according to people familiar with the matter. He also helped steer debates among finance executives on steps needed for the steel, aviation and oil-and-gas sectors to reduce carbon emissions, and on how society should account for the growing pile of assets that would be deemed worthless along the way. ""Society is trying in certain instances to pressure companies to do more, including at times what ought to be the role of government,"" said Evan Greenberg, the CEO of insurance company Chubb Ltd., who has gone fly-fishing with Mr. Fink. He added: ""I believe Larry chose consciously to approach it as an opportunity, rather than something he is expected to do.""

As a large and long-term investor in fossil fuel companies, ""we want to see these companies succeed and prosper,"" BlackRock executives wrote in a letter that a spokesman confirmed was sent at the start of the year to officials, trade groups and others in energy-rich Texas. ""We will continue to invest in and support fossil fuel companies, including Texas fossil fuel companies,"" states the memo, signed by Dalia Blass, BlackRock's head of external affairs, and copied to Mark McCombe, BlackRock's chief client officer. Although the message is consistent with its other statements, the emphasis is new after years in which BlackRock has stressed its efforts to take climate change and other environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues into account in its investment and proxy voting decisions. BlackRock faces a balancing act as some pension funds and endowments move to divest from fossil fuel stocks over climate-change concerns, and because of its size. Like rivals, BlackRock has declined to follow suit. The U.S. securities regulator is developing a new rule on corporate climate-change disclosures. In Texas, new legislation requires the state's comptroller, Glenn Hegar, to draw up a list of financial companies that boycott fossil fuels. Those firms could then be barred from state pension funds like the $197 billion Teacher Retirement System of Texas, which has about $2.5 billion with BlackRock. A spokesman for Hegar, a Republican, said via email his agency is ""currently working to establish suitable candidates for the divestment list.""

BlackRock,BLK,2022/9/7,"forced labor, freedom of association and collective bargaining, human rights abuses and corporate complicity, poor employment conditions, supply chain issues, gender inequality","BlackRock Bet Big Climate Change. Targeted Anti-ESG Movement.
The financial lexicon got a new term in 2022: ""anti-ESG."" It's the latest incursion of politics and the culture wars into the financial sphere, and one that has thrust BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, into the hot seat.
While most of the major asset management firms offer some ESG options, BlackRock (ticker: BLK) has emerged as the leader in the spaceâ€”and its public face.
That includes an August letter that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and the attorneys general of 18 other states sent to the asset manager, challenging its motives for pushing into ESG, pointing out what they deemed to be inconsistencies and conflicts with BlackRock's public statements and commitments to the green energy transition, and demanding answers about the firm's investment policies.
In letters to state officials and media statements, the firm has dismissed the allegation that it boycotts fossil fuels, calling it ""not a fact-based judgment,"" and emphasized its fiduciary duty to its clients, ""which don't allow our investment decisions to be based on any specific political or social agenda."" This week, the firm released a new letter responding to the attorneys general, in which BlackRock said it sought to ""clarify misconceptions"" about the firm, including inaccuracies about its motive for participating in various ESG-related activities.
It also stated it ""doesn't boycott energy companies or any other sector or industry."" Given how quickly the anti-ESG push is evolving, it's too early to say for sure how much of a threat such state actions pose to BlackRock's business.
Currently, assets held in ESG ETFs total about $102 billion, with BlackRock managing about 60%, says Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a financial research and data company.
In one addressed to CEOs, Fink said ""climate risk is investment risk"" and ""every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change."" In another, to clients, he noted: ""We believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing."" BlackRock's first ESG ETFâ€”the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA)â€”was launched on January 24th, 2005.
During the company's third quarter 2021 earnings call, Fink said, ""BlackRock is a leader in this, and we are seeing the flows, and I continue to see this big shift in investor portfolios as they move away from traditional indexes to more sustainable types of indexes."" BlackRock's 2009 acquisition of Barclays Global Investors helped the firm become the leading player in ETFs, thanks to the iShares suite of products.
""BlackRock also has strong relationships with institutional investors that have been early adopters on ESG."" There is also been strong demand from institutional and retail investors for ESG products in recent years, driven by factors such as an increasing awareness of climate risk and the need for companies to institute diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE & I) policies, and BlackRock has been ready to meet that demand.
""They are in these strategies for the longer term because this subset of investors has prioritized environmental, social, and governance in their investment practice."" The firmâ€”and investorsâ€”respond So far, BlackRock investors appear to be largely shrugging off the anti-ESG controversyâ€”even when it has the potential to block the firm from significant business opportunities: BlackRock's shares closed higher on the days in August when Florida and Texas blocked state fund managers from investing in funds or companies that make investment decisions based on ESG factors (though the stock has since given up those gains in the market swoon following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole.) Harry Papp, managing partner of L.
He says the firm is ""a cash flow machine"" and ""a very secure company."" Papp dismisses Brnovich's letter as ""political theater,"" adding: ""I don't think it's going to be a serious problem for BlackRock."" For now, it appears anti-ESG legislation will have a muted effect on BlackRock's bottom line.
Sanders says ESG investing is one of the fastest-growing areas in asset management in terms of new products and where money is flowing and BlackRock needs to be offering ESG products because they have a responsibility to their shareholders.
""If they weren't pursuing ESG products, where a lot of investors want to invest, BlackRock shareholders might be disappointed the company isn't capturing the market opportunity and they would potentially be losing out on future profits,"" he says.","The financial lexicon got a new term in 2022: ""anti-ESG."" It's the latest incursion of politics and the culture wars into the financial sphere, and one that has thrust BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, into the hot seat. Over the past few months, the pushback against environmental, social, and governance investingâ€”known as ESGâ€”has escalated sharply, particularly in Republican-led states. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis and the State Board of Administration adopted a resolution barring the state from considering ESG factors in its investment management practices. Texas has blacklisted 10 asset managers, including BlackRock, for supposedly ""boycotting"" the fossil fuel industry. West Virginia has barred five financial institutions, including BlackRock, from new state business on the grounds that they boycott fossil fuel companies. And with U.S. midterm elections looming and the country's political acrimony showing no signs of dissipating, this could be just the beginning. While most of the major asset management firms offer some ESG options, BlackRock (ticker: BLK) has emerged as the leader in the spaceâ€”and its public face. So, it's no surprise that the company has been directly targeted by some of the efforts to oppose investments that weigh the impact of climate change or diversity. That includes an August letter that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich and the attorneys general of 18 other states sent to the asset manager, challenging its motives for pushing into ESG, pointing out what they deemed to be inconsistencies and conflicts with BlackRock's public statements and commitments to the green energy transition, and demanding answers about the firm's investment policies. ""BlackRock is an easy target given that they're the largest asset manager,"" says Kyle Sanders, an equity research analyst with financial services firm Edward Jones who has been covering the firm since 2016. BlackRock declined to comment for this story. In letters to state officials and media statements, the firm has dismissed the allegation that it boycotts fossil fuels, calling it ""not a fact-based judgment,"" and emphasized its fiduciary duty to its clients, ""which don't allow our investment decisions to be based on any specific political or social agenda."" This week, the firm released a new letter responding to the attorneys general, in which BlackRock said it sought to ""clarify misconceptions"" about the firm, including inaccuracies about its motive for participating in various ESG-related activities. ""In managing client assets, BlackRock seeks to realize the best long-term financial results consistent with each client's investment guidelines. Our participation in these initiatives is entirely consistent with our fiduciary obligations,"" the firm said. It also stated it ""doesn't boycott energy companies or any other sector or industry."" Given how quickly the anti-ESG push is evolving, it's too early to say for sure how much of a threat such state actions pose to BlackRock's business. So far, there is little evidence that they have hurt the investing titan in any significant way. But being shut out of potentially lucrative money management deals in numerous states certainly could have an impact in the longer term. More immediately, the situation has put BlackRock in the awkward position of becoming the face of ""woke"" investingâ€”a somewhat ironic place to be for a firm that has invested billions in the fossil fuel industry. Now, BlackRock finds itself publicly insisting on its oil bona fides, while at the same time continuing to market its climate-sensitive ESG funds. Becoming an ESG heavyweight BlackRock's dominance within ESG is hard to overstate: the firm has seven of the 10 largest ESG funds, including the top two, iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA ETF (ESGU) and iShares ESG Aware MSCI EAFE ETF (ESGD). In the second quarter of this year, ESGU topped the chart for flows into sustainable mutual funds and ETFs, attracting $477 million, according to Morningstar (MORN). Last April, the firm introduced the BlackRock U.S. Carbon Transition Readiness ETF (LCTU), in what was the largest ESG ETF launch ever. Currently, assets held in ESG ETFs total about $102 billion, with BlackRock managing about 60%, says Todd Rosenbluth, head of research at VettaFi, a financial research and data company. BlackRock's outspoken CEO, Larry Fink, has become one of the industry's loudest voices on ESG investingâ€”for better or worseâ€”in large part thanks to two letters the firm published in 2020. In one addressed to CEOs, Fink said ""climate risk is investment risk"" and ""every government, company, and shareholder must confront climate change."" In another, to clients, he noted: ""We believe that sustainability should be our new standard for investing."" BlackRock's first ESG ETFâ€”the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF (SUSA)â€”was launched on January 24th, 2005. During the company's third quarter 2021 earnings call, Fink said, ""BlackRock is a leader in this, and we are seeing the flows, and I continue to see this big shift in investor portfolios as they move away from traditional indexes to more sustainable types of indexes."" BlackRock's 2009 acquisition of Barclays Global Investors helped the firm become the leading player in ETFs, thanks to the iShares suite of products. That market dominance has enabled it to win inflows for its sustainable investing products. ""BlackRock's ESG suite is competitively priced as the firm is able to use its scale as an advantage,"" says Rosenbluth. ""BlackRock also has strong relationships with institutional investors that have been early adopters on ESG."" There is also been strong demand from institutional and retail investors for ESG products in recent years, driven by factors such as an increasing awareness of climate risk and the need for companies to institute diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE & I) policies, and BlackRock has been ready to meet that demand. ""It has been two years since I wrote that climate risk is investment risk,"" Fink said in his 2022 CEO letter. ""And in that short period, we have seen a tectonic shift of capital. Sustainable investments have now reached $4 trillion. Actions and ambitions toward decarbonization have also increased. This is just the beginning â€?the tectonic shift toward sustainable investing is still accelerating."" Observers don't expect to see that trend reverse. ""BlackRock is likely to continue to see new money move into their ESG ETFs. And existing shareholders are likely to stay loyal,"" says Rosenbluth. ""They are in these strategies for the longer term because this subset of investors has prioritized environmental, social, and governance in their investment practice."" The firmâ€”and investorsâ€”respond So far, BlackRock investors appear to be largely shrugging off the anti-ESG controversyâ€”even when it has the potential to block the firm from significant business opportunities: BlackRock's shares closed higher on the days in August when Florida and Texas blocked state fund managers from investing in funds or companies that make investment decisions based on ESG factors (though the stock has since given up those gains in the market swoon following Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's remarks at Jackson Hole.) Harry Papp, managing partner of L. Roy Papp & Associates, an Arizona investment advisor, calls ESG ""a strong profit center"" for BlackRock. Papp has clients who have owned BlackRock shares for a decade and he sees no reason for that to change. ""We are buying BlackRock right now,"" he says. ""We think it's attractive."" Some of those involved in the managing state fundsâ€”including in locations where BlackRock and ESG are being targetedâ€”remain skeptical that the moves will have any major impact. Papp sits on the boards of the Arizona State Board of Investment Board of Investmentâ€”which looks after about $16.5 billion in short-term investments for the state and state agencies and also oversees the state's $7.5 billion Permanent Land Endowment Trust Fundâ€”and the $18 billionPublic Safety Personnel Retirement System, which invests on behalf of the state's police, firemen, judges, corrections staff, and elected officials. Both entities own BlackRock stock, which has a healthy dividend of 2.8%. He says the firm is ""a cash flow machine"" and ""a very secure company."" Papp dismisses Brnovich's letter as ""political theater,"" adding: ""I don't think it's going to be a serious problem for BlackRock."" For now, it appears anti-ESG legislation will have a muted effect on BlackRock's bottom line. In Texas, for example, the Texas Teachers Retirement Systemâ€”the state's largest investment fundâ€”owned 64,779 shares of BlackRock on July 31, according to a list of holdings on its website. That is worth around $45 million today, based on BlackRock's closing price of $691.92 on Thursday. To put that in perspective, BlackRock's assets under management at the end of the second quarter stood at $8.5 trillion. Despite the spike in anti-ESG headlines, ""there are still lots of insurance funds, foundations, and institutions that are racing to embrace ESG,"" says Sanders of Edward Jones. ""BlackRock is also winning mandates because there are a lot of people who want ESG and more climate-related products."" The relative stability of ESG funds during this tumultuous market is an indication of their staying power. During the second quarter, open-end and exchange-traded funds overall in the U.S. suffered steep outflows of $200 billion, according to Morningstar. But U.S. sustainable fund flows fared better, with a more modest $1.6 billion in outflows. ""The continued growth of U.S. sustainable funds even during a period of poor performance could signal that investor demand for sustainable funds is 'stickier' than broader U.S. demand,"" wrote Alyssa Stankiewicz, associate director of sustainability research at Morningstar. Sanders says ESG investing is one of the fastest-growing areas in asset management in terms of new products and where money is flowing and BlackRock needs to be offering ESG products because they have a responsibility to their shareholders. ""If they weren't pursuing ESG products, where a lot of investors want to invest, BlackRock shareholders might be disappointed the company isn't capturing the market opportunity and they would potentially be losing out on future profits,"" he says. Aniket Shah, global head of ESG and sustainable finance strategy at Jefferies, notes that for every red state pushing back on the sector, there is a blue state that is embracing it. ""For all of the backlash, there is at the same time incredible support for ESG in the State of New York, State of California, State of Illinois,"" says Shah. ""There are two sides to this that are being drawn around political lines."" Less clear-cut risks emerge Still, the anti-ESG movement does present BlackRock with a public relations challenge. Over the years, environmental groups have criticized the firm for not doing enough to divest from oil and gas companies. Now, to rebut states that accuse it of boycotting energy companies, BlackRock is touting the fact that it has ""hundreds of billions of dollars invested in these companies globally"" and about $170 billion invested in U.S. companies, potentially giving ammunition to those who've accused it of greenwashing. Meanwhile, the company finds itself in the middle of political debate over climate change and accusations that ""woke"" or politically correct ideas are unfairly influencing the business world. For all the strength of BlackRock's ESG business, and the sector as a whole, it's still too early to know how the anti-ESG movement will evolveâ€”and what future risks it might trigger. Or what legal challenges the firm might mount in response. ""We are still in the early days of seeing how this all plays itself out. We don't know what's going to come next. We don't know what the legal response is going to be,"" says Shah. ""This is fairly new territory and ESG is a newer concept and there hasn't been this kind of action before.""

Sen. Wyden last week accused the drug maker of skirting federal tax rules in 2012 by transferring patents to an Ireland-based affiliate.
Mr. Wyden claims the transfer helped Bristol Myers reduce its tax bill by about $1.4 billion.
As the IRS notes, accounting firm PwC and law firm White & Case affirmed Bristol Myers' full tax compliance before the plan took effect.
It also judges whether tax savings count as ""substantial."" The murkiness of the law explains why the IRS seems to have come late to investigating Bristol Myers.","Democrats this week are renewing their calls to cap prescription drug prices, and Sen. Ron Wyden has found a scapegoat in the cause. The Senate Finance Chairman is casting an ordinary tax decision as an outrage in need of a government crackdown. The target is Bristol Myers Squibb, maker of blood-clot and cancer drugs. Sen. Wyden last week accused the drug maker of skirting federal tax rules in 2012 by transferring patents to an Ireland-based affiliate. In a letter to Bristol Myers CEO Giovanni Caforio, the Senator said the Internal Revenue Service restricts ""the shifting of income and profits within partnerships in order to avoid paying U.S. taxes."" The facts of the tax maneuver appear straightforward. According to the IRS, Bristol Myers in 2012 transferred patents for several drugs to a new subsidiary in Ireland. The subsidiary then claimed new tax deductions in Dublin for amortization on the drugs. Mr. Wyden claims the transfer helped Bristol Myers reduce its tax bill by about $1.4 billion. That kind of saving enrages tax maximalists, but it's a feature of international competition, as countries vie for highly mobile intangible assets. As the IRS notes, accounting firm PwC and law firm White & Case affirmed Bristol Myers' full tax compliance before the plan took effect. Mr. Wyden suggests that the restructure violates ""anti-abuse"" tax rules, yet those are wildly subjective. The IRS decides whether an intellectual-property transfer is meant to reduce taxes or merely does so incidentally. It also judges whether tax savings count as ""substantial."" The murkiness of the law explains why the IRS seems to have come late to investigating Bristol Myers. Its complaint against the company leaked to the press in April 2021, and the documents don't indicate that the agency took an interest in the tax maneuver before 2020. The investigation became public because of a botched redactionâ€”one of several recent IRS privacy blunders. Neither Bristol Myers nor the IRS has said whether the review continues. Mr. Wyden's campaign may seem oddly timedâ€”reviving a two-year-old probe of a 10-year-old tax change. But on Tuesday Sen. Wyden told reporters that Democrats will resume their drive to let Medicare negotiate down the fees it pays drug makers. The provision has so far failed to pass as part of President Biden's $4.7 trillion social-spending bill. Politicians need villains, even if they're invented. When a Democrat accuses a company of avoiding taxes, keep in mind who wrote the tax laws that allowed the deduction.

The settlement with 47 states and Washington, D.C. was announced on Tuesday by several state attorneys general. Boston Scientific also agreed to describe more accurately to consumers the safety and risks of using mesh. Johnson & Johnson and its Ethicon unit reached a similar $117 million multistate settlement over the devices in 2019, while Becton Dickinson and Co and its CR Bard unit reached a $60 million accord last September. The devices have also been the subject of widespread litigation by women against manufacturers. Lawyers for some of the plaintiffs have estimated that settlements between the industry and more than 100,000 women may reach $11 billion. Pelvic mesh devices, also called transvaginal mesh devices, were intended to be implanted in the pelvic floor to treat the common conditions of stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse, where organs shift from their normal positions. The states accused Boston Scientific of concealing potential serious risks of using the devices, including chronic pain, urinary dysfunction and a new onset of incontinence. ""While Boston Scientific was putting income before the health of people in need of care, women were put in danger,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. Boston Scientific said the settlement was not an admission of misconduct or liability, and was in shareholders' best interest. The payment is covered by the Marlborough, Massachusetts-based company's existing reserves. In April 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered Boston Scientific and the Danish company Coloplast A/S , the two remaining makers of transvaginal surgical mesh implants for pelvic order prolapse, to halt sales. It said neither company demonstrated a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for their devices.

Write to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and Alexander Gladstone at alexander.gladstone@wsj.com Russia Averts Default After Investors Receive Foreign-Debt Payments","Citigroup is one of the biggest U.S. banks abroad and sits in the middle of important financial infrastructure. PHOTO: GABBY JONES for The Wall Street Journal Russia made good on payments to foreign bondholders, according to investors and traders, averting default on its foreign debt in the face of the war in Ukraine and punishing Western sanctions. Holders of two Russian dollar bonds said coupon payments arrived Thursday, a day late, but well within the 30-day grace period granted under the terms of the bonds. The bond payments are a sign that exceptions the West put into sanctions to allow certain transactions, including for debt payments and energy, are working in some cases. Still, financial institutions are reluctant to touch Russian money without strong assurances that what they are doing is legal, leading to delays and confusion. Russia's Ministry of Finance said in a statement earlier Thursday that it had remitted payments to a correspondent bank and would provide future updates on whether funds had reached a London branch of Citigroup Inc., which processes payments on behalf of bondholders. Russia's finance minister has said he wasn't sure if the payments would go through, blaming U.S. sanctions for setting the country on the path toward default. A spokeswoman for Citigroup declined to comment. JPMorgan Chase & Co. is the correspondent bank that links the Central Bank of Russia to Citigroup. JPMorgan received the full $117 million for both Russian sovereign bonds' coupon payments and made the transfer to Citigroup, according to a person familiar with the matter. The Treasury Department has said that current U.S. sanctions don't prohibit Russia from making debt payments. Prices on the bonds rallied Thursday on hopes that the payments would go through. Russia's bonds maturing in 2023 were quoted around 41 cents on the dollar Thursday, compared with 27 cents Wednesday, according to AdvantageData. Those maturing in 2043 were bought and sold for around 32 cents Thursday, up from about 22 cents Wednesday. They traded above 100 cents on the dollar before the war. Russian credit default swaps, which would pay out a windfall if Russia defaults, also rallied on news of the payments. The cost of a five year CDS contract dropped to 41% of the total value of the debt to be insured, compared to as high as 60% as of Tuesday, according to data from ICE Data Services. The last time Russia reneged on its foreign debts was after the Bolshevik Revolution in 1918. Russia defaulted on its local-government debt in 1998 as the post-Soviet economy struggled to find its feet. The payment on the dollar bonds doesn't remove Russia's default risk completely. Russia could also default on a local-currency bond that was due for payment earlier this month but that foreign investors haven't received. Ratings company Fitch said that if the Russian state doesn't pay holders of its local-currency bonds in the 30 days after it didn't forward payments to foreign bondholders on March 2, it would declare the country in default. Russia has an additional $615 million of bond payments to make to foreign creditors this month, and a maturing $2 billion bond that it will have to pay in full in April. In theory, Russia has plenty of money. Heading into the war with Ukraine it had accumulated more than $630 billion in foreign-currency reserves, which in normal times it can use to pay its debts. But the punishing U.S. sanctions on Russia's central bank and finance ministry have thrown into question what Russia is permitted to do with the reserves. Many investors got rid of their Russian bonds at the start of the conflict, selling them to more opportunistic investors who were betting that the payments would be allowed. One money manager who holds Russian bonds said it made sense for the U.S. to allow payments. Every dollar Russia spends on bond repayments is less money it has in its warchest, even if it is difficult to use those dollars because of sanctions. The paymentâ€”and the role of Citigroup and JPMorganâ€”highlights the complex relationships that built up over the years between Western banks and Russia. Many banks rushed in after the end of Communism, but have trimmed down their presence after the 1998 bond default and the 2014 Russian annexation of Crimea. Several U.S. banks, including JPMorgan and Citigroup have said they are unwinding ties to Russia, but that the process would take time as they shut down client relationships. U.S. sanctions that came into effect in 2019 blocked American banks from helping Russia raise money in debt markets, but only affected new issuances. The Russian dollar bonds at the center of the missed payments were sold in 2013. â€”Matt Wirz, Alexander Saeedy and Anna Hirtenstein contributed to this article.

Citigroup,C,2022/3/30,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, misleading communication","Citigroup Claws Saudi Arabia; 'They're game'; U.S. lender favor kingdom post-9/11 exit roiled Saudi officialdom
That would put it on par with competitors such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. in offering banking and payments to international companies in Saudi Arabia and could lead to lucrative work with the kingdom's biggest institutions.
Saudi Arabia has struggled to attract foreign investment, and Prince Mohammed, the country's de facto ruler, has turned to the financial-services industry to inject capital into his economy.
For Citi, Saudi Arabia represents a hot market.
Citi hopes its revival in Saudi Arabia will position it to benefit as the kingdom privatizes billions of dollars worth of government assets, its $500 billion sovereign-wealth fund becomes more active overseas, and its biggest companies look to expand abroad.
The banking license would allow Citi to take deposits from firms inside Saudi Arabia and manage their cash and offer local payments.
In November, Ms. Fraser led a Citi delegation to Saudi Arabia to meet officials and regulators and visited the desert camp of billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, once the bank's largest single shareholder.
Her predecessor, Michael Corbat, met him several times as Citi sought to demonstrate its support for Saudi Arabia and came away from the interactions energized about the changes in the kingdom.
Ebru Pakcan, Citi's chief executive for emerging markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa, said growing demand in Saudi Arabia for financial advice has helped the bank overcome the impact of its hasty exit.
The Saudi banking industry is much different than when Citi left in 2004.
Saudi banking-privacy regulations made it difficult for Citi to access customer data at Saudi American Bank, which it managed and owned a 20% stake in, said people familiar with the events.
It was one of several banks that, together, lent the kingdom $10 billion in 2016 and then coordinated Saudi Arabia's debut international sovereign bond.","RIYADH, Saudi Arabiaâ€”When Citigroup Inc. shut down operations in Saudi Arabia after Sept. 11, 2001, government officials here felt betrayed. For years after, the Saudis snubbed Citi as executives realized they had made a mistake and tried to rebuild their business. Two decades later, the third-biggest U.S. bank has again found favor in the kingdom as one of the foreign lenders helping Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman modernize its oil-heavy economy. In recent years, Citi has participated in the country's biggest listings, including the offering of oil giant Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco. It obtained a license in 2018 for investment banking, hired local staff and opened an office. It now plans to deepen its activity by applying for a full banking permit. That would put it on par with competitors such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. in offering banking and payments to international companies in Saudi Arabia and could lead to lucrative work with the kingdom's biggest institutions. ""They paid their dues,"" said a senior Saudi official. ""They were in the penalty box long enough. They're back in the game."" The bank's bumpy road back to favor provides a glimpse into the business environment in this opaque G-20 country and how it is changing under Prince Mohammed, whose social and economic overhauls have drawn praise and brutal crackdown on dissent sparked outrage. Saudi Arabia has struggled to attract foreign investment, and Prince Mohammed, the country's de facto ruler, has turned to the financial-services industry to inject capital into his economy. For Citi, Saudi Arabia represents a hot market. Already, it advised last year on the $1.2 billion listing of ACWA Power, the country's biggest renewable-energy firm, and the $1 billion sale of a stake in its stock exchange. It was a bookrunner on the December sale of a $3.2 billion stake in Saudi Telecom Co. by the Saudi sovereign-wealth fund and advised the fund on the $380 million acquisition of English soccer club Newcastle in October, according to people familiar with the deals. Citi hopes its revival in Saudi Arabia will position it to benefit as the kingdom privatizes billions of dollars worth of government assets, its $500 billion sovereign-wealth fund becomes more active overseas, and its biggest companies look to expand abroad. The government also continues to explore asset sales of Aramco, the world's biggest oil company. Few emerging markets globally offer Citi such a panoply of potential fees. Those efforts dovetail with a new strategy put forward by Chief Executive Jane Fraser, who last year announced Citi would sell unprofitable retail banking assets and focus on investment banking and managing companies' bank accounts and rich individuals' wealth. The banking license would allow Citi to take deposits from firms inside Saudi Arabia and manage their cash and offer local payments. In November, Ms. Fraser led a Citi delegation to Saudi Arabia to meet officials and regulators and visited the desert camp of billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, once the bank's largest single shareholder. She held a falcon and patted a camel, before eating dinner with the prince, according to a video published by his company. She told Prince Alwaleedâ€”the highest-profile detainee in a 2017 roundup of businessmen and royals in Riyadh's Ritz Carlton Hotelâ€”that she was pleased with the way the Saudi market was moving, said a person familiar with the exchange. In return, the prince praised her global strategy revamp, saying ""you're taking some tough decisions,"" the person said. Ms. Fraser didn't see Prince Mohammed. Her predecessor, Michael Corbat, met him several times as Citi sought to demonstrate its support for Saudi Arabia and came away from the interactions energized about the changes in the kingdom. After the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018, Mr. Corbat pulled out of Riyadh's flagship investment conference. He returned the following year but didn't meet Prince Mohammed again. Ebru Pakcan, Citi's chief executive for emerging markets in Europe, Middle East and Africa, said growing demand in Saudi Arabia for financial advice has helped the bank overcome the impact of its hasty exit. ""People will get over that because they need to continue to think about how they are going to evolve,"" she said. Still, the bank faces competition. Regulators have dished out full banking licenses in recent years to Standard Chartered and Credit Suisse. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are expanding staff, and HSBC Holdings PLC, too, in recent years has carved out a special role in the kingdom. From 2017 to 2021, JPMorgan made the most investment-banking revenue in the kingdom, at $143 million, closely followed by HSBC, and then Citi at $134 million, according to research firm Dealogic. The Saudi banking industry is much different than when Citi left in 2004. At the time, the U.S. government was investigating potential Saudi links to the terrorist attacks that felled the World Trade Center. Saudi banking-privacy regulations made it difficult for Citi to access customer data at Saudi American Bank, which it managed and owned a 20% stake in, said people familiar with the events. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What is your outlook for financial-services companies doing business in Saudi Arabia? Join the conversation below. Citi feared it couldn't determine whether 9/11 financiers held accounts, leaving it unable to answer questions from Congress and vulnerable to investigation, these people said. Then the only U.S. bank with a retail-banking subsidiary in the kingdom, Citi pulled the plug. Within a few years, executives in New York sought to return, but the damage in Riyadh was done, said the people familiar with its exit. For the next decade, Citi sought to get back in Saudi officials' good graces. Prince Alwaleed tried unsuccessfully to usher the bank back. The ascent of Prince Mohammed turned out to be the key for Citi. In 2015, King Salman bin Abdulaziz ascended to the throne and put his young son in charge of the economy. Prince Mohammed's ambitious plans to sell shares in Aramco and create new industries needed access to the global-financial system. The government at that time had no debt outstanding with international investors. A senior Saudi financial official called Citi, inviting it to help. On the other end of the line was Carmen Haddad, a veteran Citi banker who had been cultivating relationships in the kingdom since 2000. Citi may officially still have been a pariah in some Saudi circles, but that didn't prevent it from lending money to the kingdom. It was one of several banks that, together, lent the kingdom $10 billion in 2016 and then coordinated Saudi Arabia's debut international sovereign bond. In a sign of its seriousness, Citi dispatched its head of global-capital markets from New York to join the sales roadshow with potential investors. The deals helped dispel doubts among Saudi officials about the bank's commitment to the kingdom.

        <Matched Summary>: Citigroup Claws Saudi Arabia; 'They're game'; U.S. lender favor kingdom post-9/11 exit roiled Saudi officialdom
Saudi Arabia has struggled to attract foreign investment, and Prince Mohammed, the country's de facto ruler, has turned to the financial-services industry to inject capital into his economy.
For Citi, Saudi Arabia represents a hot market.
Citi hopes its revival in Saudi Arabia will position it to benefit as the kingdom privatizes billions of dollars worth of government assets, its $500 billion sovereign-wealth fund becomes more active overseas, and its biggest companies look to expand abroad.
The banking license would allow Citi to take deposits from firms inside Saudi Arabia and manage their cash and offer local payments.
In November, Ms. Fraser led a Citi delegation to Saudi Arabia to meet officials and regulators and visited the desert camp of billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, once the bank's largest single shareholder.
Her predecessor, Michael Corbat, met him several times as Citi sought to demonstrate its support for Saudi Arabia and came away from the interactions energized about the changes in the kingdom.

Conagra Brands,CAG,2020/4/19,"occupational health and safety issues, epidemics pandemics","Coronavirus Spreads Farms, Packaged-Food Plants; Conagra, Kraft Heinz companies close plants cleaning workers tested positive
The coronavirus pandemic is deepening challenges for the U.S. food system, forcing plant closures and infecting farmworkers at a time when packaged-food companies say demand for groceries has never been higher.
Conagra said 20 of the 700 workers at its factory in Missouri that makes chicken pot pies and other frozen meals had contracted the virus, prompting the plant to close for 10 days beginning April 17.
Flowers Foods Inc. said it closed a baking plant in Tucker, Ga., for a few weeks recently after workers tested positive for the virus.
The disruptions come amid heightened worry over the nation's food supply chain as illnesses close meatpacking plants, curtailing output of chicken, beef and pork and limiting supplies at grocery stores.
Pork giant Smithfield Foods Inc. has shut down its Sioux Falls, S.D., plant, which with hundreds of infected workers has become a major coronavirus hot spot.
To help shore up the food supply chain and help farmers hurt by collapsing commodity prices and restaurant demand, the Trump administration last week pledged to spend $19 billion in direct payments to farmers and ranchers as well as government food purchases.
They say the production process for packaged food is typically more automated than work done on farms, slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants.
Workers are also falling ill on farms that supply packaged-food companies.","The coronavirus pandemic is deepening challenges for the U.S. food system, forcing plant closures and infecting farmworkers at a time when packaged-food companies say demand for groceries has never been higher. Production has been curtailed at a range of facilities across the country, including a Kraft Heinz Co. macaroni-and-cheese plant and a Conagra Brands Inc. frozen-meal factory. At the same time, food companies are instituting precautions to maintain or restore production so they can keep grocery stores stocked. Conagra said 20 of the 700 workers at its factory in Missouri that makes chicken pot pies and other frozen meals had contracted the virus, prompting the plant to close for 10 days beginning April 17. A spokesman said the company needs the time to conduct a deep cleaning and prepare more rigorous preventive measures for when employees return to the plant. Flowers Foods Inc. said it closed a baking plant in Tucker, Ga., for a few weeks recently after workers tested positive for the virus. The company, whose brands include Wonder Bread and Tastykake, wouldn't say how many of the plant's 255 workers were sick. The disruptions come amid heightened worry over the nation's food supply chain as illnesses close meatpacking plants, curtailing output of chicken, beef and pork and limiting supplies at grocery stores. Pork giant Smithfield Foods Inc. has shut down its Sioux Falls, S.D., plant, which with hundreds of infected workers has become a major coronavirus hot spot. To help shore up the food supply chain and help farmers hurt by collapsing commodity prices and restaurant demand, the Trump administration last week pledged to spend $19 billion in direct payments to farmers and ranchers as well as government food purchases. Even as the new coronavirus forces more plant closures, some facilities that had been closed because of the outbreak are reopening. In Pennsylvania this week, meatpacking facilities run by Cargill Inc., JBS USA Holdings Inc. and Empire Kosher Poultry Inc. will ramp back up with new safeguards. The measures include footprints painted on the floor to mark recommended distances between employees, and tents set up for extra cafeteria seating, company and union officials said. Food makers outside the meat sector were initially able to avoid factory closures when the coronavirus began spreading throughout the U.S. in March. They say the production process for packaged food is typically more automated than work done on farms, slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants. Companies such as Kraft Heinz, Danone SA and General Mills Inc. also took safety steps, including taking workers' temperatures and slowing production where necessary to allow for wider spacing and fewer workers on manufacturing. Nonetheless, packaged-food executives are growing concerned about mounting illnesses at their plants and those in their supply chain. ""Everyone is most worried about factory workers,"" said Patrick Criteser, chief executive of Tillamook County Creamery Association. ""We can find different packaging-materials or raw-materials suppliers, but we need those plants to keep operating."" Tillamook, a dairy cooperative based in Oregon, has implemented new safety measures in its plant, which helped keep the one Covid-19 case recorded there from infecting more people. That employee has recovered from the coronavirus disease and is back at work, Mr. Criteser said. Kraft Heinz's macaroni-and-cheese factory in Springfield, Mo., reported two Covid-19 cases last month and closed for a few days for cleaning. Campbell Soup Co. said its Pepperidge Farm bakery in Denver, Pa., had five cases and ""paused certain operations"" for a deep cleaning. A Frito-Lay factory in Modesto, Calif., shut down for a couple of days for a deep cleaning after an undisclosed number of workers contracted the virus. Frito-Lay, owned by PepsiCo Inc., employs 600 people there. Workers are also falling ill on farms that supply packaged-food companies. Three agricultural workers in Cayuga County in western New York, for instance, tested positive for the new coronavirus, one of whomâ€”a man in his 40s who worked on a dairy farmâ€”has died. The county health department says it has conducted contact tracing on farms and that a team of nurses has traveled to farms to test symptomatic employees. A North Carolina farmworker also tested positive, according to an email from a regional health clinic viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The worker was quarantined and is recovering, the email said. The regional clinic has prepared hundreds of Covid-19 information packets in English and Spanish, as well as handmade masks and a supply of gloves, for distribution to farmworkers through a faith-based group. The clinic is planning a Zoom conference for local farmers to provide information about the pandemic and is opening its coronavirus help line to farmers. STAY INFORMED Get a coronavirus briefing six days a week, and a weekly Health newsletter once the crisis abates: Sign up here. Across the country, the busy spring season is starting to bring thousands of workers to farms where they live and work in close proximity to one another. In North Carolina last year, nearly 22,000 migrant workers, largely from Mexico, joined others on farms to harvest crops including tobacco, sweet potatoes and cucumbers. Some farms and labor contractors have been working to prevent the virus's spread by checking migrant workers' temperatures before they cross the U.S.-Mexico border, spacing workers further apart in fields and delivering groceries to housing camps. The Trump administration in recent weeks has taken steps to make it easier for farms to hire migrant workers. It also pledged $16 billion in payments to farmers and ranchers and $3 billion in mass commodity purchases to be distributed through food banks. Cattle ranchers, dairy and hog farmers are set to receive $9.6 billion in direct payments, while row crop farmers will receive $3.9 billion and specialty-crop producers will get $2.1 billion, according to Sen. John Hoeven (R, N.D.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture Appropriations Committee. Farm groups welcomed the relief program, but said it isn't enough to offset plunging commodity prices and demand from restaurants. Hog farmers will receive $1.6 billion in direct payments, though the National Pork Producers Council estimates industrywide losses for the rest of the year will total $5 billion as farmers lose $37 per hog they market. Joe Glauber, former chief economist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said also that he had hoped some federal funds would be dedicated to preventing illnesses in the nation's food plants.

CLEVELANDâ€”A $260 million late-night settlement between four drug companies and two Ohio counties averted a trial here over who is to blame for the opioid crisis, clearing the way for broader talks aimed at resolving thousands of opioid-addiction cases nationwide.
Lawyers for the plaintiffs and companies said the settlement could be an important step toward a multibillion-dollar deal that brings closure to 2,500 lawsuits and sends needed money to communities hard-hit by opioid addiction.
Municipalities have balked at a comprehensive settlement negotiated by state attorneys general that includes $22 billion in cash and up to $26 billion in donated addiction-treatment drugs and services, saying that it isn't enough money and that they want some control over how it is spent.
Representatives for the cities and counties say any broader settlement should immediately go toward helping alleviate the impacts of opioid addiction, which was a feature of Monday's Ohio deal.
In a joint statement, they said that while they disputed the allegations against them, settling with the trial counties ""is an important stepping stone to achieving a global resolution and delivering meaningful relief."" Teva said separately that it is ""pleased to positively contribute to solving the nationwide opioid epidemic."" Walgreens distanced itself from the other defendants, saying it never manufactured, marketed or wholesaled prescription opioid medications, or sold any opioid medicines to pain clinics, internet pharmacies or ""pill mills."" Walgreens, widely known as a pharmacy, had been included in the trial for its role as a drug distributor to its own stores.
Monday's settlement, he said, ""does not in any way, shape or form slow down our efforts to reach a global resolution that makes sense."" Monday's settlement, lawyers involved say, can't be directly extrapolated into what a larger deal might look like, since the pressure of an imminent trial often leads to larger payouts.
The attorneys general of Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Pennsylvania, who have been leading talks, said Monday they are working on a resolution that ensures companies change their business practices and is ""distributed fairly across states, cities, and counties and used wisely to combat the crisis."" Texas plaintiffs lawyer Mark Lanier expressed disappointment outside of court Monday that a jury wouldn't hear the narrative he had crafted for the counties' opening statements.","CLEVELANDâ€”A $260 million late-night settlement between four drug companies and two Ohio counties averted a trial here over who is to blame for the opioid crisis, clearing the way for broader talks aimed at resolving thousands of opioid-addiction cases nationwide.

Municipalities have balked at a comprehensive settlement negotiated by state attorneys general that includes $22 billion in cash and up to $26 billion in donated addiction-treatment drugs and services, saying that it isn't enough money and that they want some control over how it is spent. For now, Monday's deal will direct $215 million to Ohio's Cuyahoga and Summit counties from the country's top drug distributors: McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. The countiesâ€”which encompass the Cleveland and Akron metro areasâ€”will also receive $20 million in cash and the donation of $25 million in addiction-treatment drugs from Israel-based drug manufacturer Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. A fifth defendant, Walgreens Boots Alliance, didn't reach a deal. The trial against it was postponed. The trial, had it gone forward, would have been the first time documents would be presented and witnesses questioned in open court about how drug distributors allegedly contributed to the opioid crisis. Lawyers negotiated over the phone until nearly 1 a.m. Monday to reach the settlements, even as trial attorneys were putting the finishing touches on opening statements. U.S. District Judge Dan Polster got a call around midnight alerting him the trial might not happen. Lawyers will now attempt to bridge the deep differences not only between the plaintiffs and defendants, but among the hundreds of states, counties, cities and Native American tribes bringing suits. The municipalities say they want to avoid the outcome of the 1990s tobacco litigation, in which a $206 billion settlement went to the states and was often spent to fill budget holes. Representatives for the cities and counties say any broader settlement should immediately go toward helping alleviate the impacts of opioid addiction, which was a feature of Monday's Ohio deal. ""We are going to utilize these funds to get people on the right path,"" said Cuyahoga County prosecutor Michael O'Malley, called his county a ""poster child"" for opioid addiction. The opioid lawsuits have become a major liability for companies up and down the pharmaceutical supply chain. The lawsuits broadly allege that drug manufacturers pushed opioid painkillers for widespread use without adequately warning of the risks of addiction and that distributors allowed high volumes of pills to flood into communities and be diverted for improper use. At least 400,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses of legal and illegal opioids since 1999, according to federal data. One of the opioid litigation's largest initial targets, OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma LP, filed for bankruptcy in September and is trying to implement a global deal with states and communities it values at between $10 billion and $12 billion. An earlier trial, in Oklahoma, ended with a $572 million verdictagainst the lone defendant, Johnson & Johnson, though a judge has said he plans to reduce it by at least $100 million because of a mathematical error. The two Ohio counties's cases had been selected to go to trial first from more than 2,300 federal-court opioid lawsuits that are consolidated before Judge Polster. The three drug distributors, which serve as middlemen that ship drug orders placed by pharmacies and hospitals, have argued that they complied with federal regulations and that they must balance their mission to deliver medicine against efforts to prevent and detect illegal diversion of those drugs. In a joint statement, they said that while they disputed the allegations against them, settling with the trial counties ""is an important stepping stone to achieving a global resolution and delivering meaningful relief."" Teva said separately that it is ""pleased to positively contribute to solving the nationwide opioid epidemic."" Walgreens distanced itself from the other defendants, saying it never manufactured, marketed or wholesaled prescription opioid medications, or sold any opioid medicines to pain clinics, internet pharmacies or ""pill mills."" Walgreens, widely known as a pharmacy, had been included in the trial for its role as a drug distributor to its own stores. Paying just the two counties helped the companies avoid potentially embarrassing internal documents and details from coming to light but left thousands more cases unresolved. ""This is not a pause, this is not a time to catch our breath,"" said Paul Geller, a Florida lawyer representing local and state governments in opioid cases. Monday's settlement, he said, ""does not in any way, shape or form slow down our efforts to reach a global resolution that makes sense."" Monday's settlement, lawyers involved say, can't be directly extrapolated into what a larger deal might look like, since the pressure of an imminent trial often leads to larger payouts. McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen shares all traded down on Monday. According to investment bank R.W. Baird, investors are concerned that there is still uncertainty about an ultimate payment in a broad settlement. A group of state attorneys general have advocated a deal that includes $18 billion to be paid over 18 years from AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and McKesson; $4 billion from Johnson & Johnson over a shorter time frame; and the donation of drugs from Teva valued at $23 billion plus $250 million in cash. But the local governments say the money doesn't come fast enough to help them address the ramifications of the opioid crisis and that too much of the funds would be controlled at the state level. ""It's got to be fair. It's got to be now,"" Joe Rice, one of the lead plaintiffs' lawyers in the federal cases, said of what it'll take to reach a global deal. The attorneys general of Texas, North Carolina, Tennessee and Pennsylvania, who have been leading talks, said Monday they are working on a resolution that ensures companies change their business practices and is ""distributed fairly across states, cities, and counties and used wisely to combat the crisis."" Texas plaintiffs lawyer Mark Lanier expressed disappointment outside of court Monday that a jury wouldn't hear the narrative he had crafted for the counties' opening statements. He planned to open, he said, by walking jurors through the history of opioid addiction dating into the early 1800s. He planned to show a first-edition copy of L. Frank Baum's ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" from 1900, which includes a scene of the heroine Dorothy falling asleep in a field of poppies, overcome by the poison the flowers contain. He then would have detailed for the jurors the regulatory landscape the drug companies face and allegations against the five companies, including an internal email from one defendant that Mr. Lanier said cavalierly stated, with a misspelling, that ""the DEA can suk it,"" referring to the Drug Enforcement Administration. A preacher as well as a lawyer, Mr. Lanier said he spent Sunday giving a sermon and teaching at his church in Houston, celebrating his 59th birthday at his mom's house, then flying to Cleveland to finish preparing.

The regulator said the Dublin, Ohio-based pharmaceutical distributor failed to detect improper transactions made to employees of its former Chinese pharmaceutical and medical-device distribution subsidiary, Cardinal China. A Cardinal Health spokeswoman said in an emailed statement that the company had voluntarily disclosed the potential violations related to the relationship Cardinal China had with the beauty and cosmetics company to regulators. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Cardinal agreed to cease-and-desist orders and to pay $5.4 million in disgorgement as well as $2.5 million and $916,887 in prejudgment interest to the SEC. From 2010 to 2016, Cardinal China employed thousands of workers and managed two large marketing accounts on behalf of a European beauty and cosmetics supplier, as well as served as the supplier's exclusive product distributor in China, the SEC said. The European supplier managed the day-to-day activities of the employees, and used funds from Cardinal China's marketing accounts to promote the cosmetic company's products, the SEC said. There was also a profit-sharing agreement with the European company that gave Cardinal a percentage of profit from sales derived from the improper payments, the SEC said. Therefore, Cardinal made about $5.4 million from this relationship between 2013 and 2016, the agency said. The agency said Cardinal didn't apply full accounting controls on the marketing accounts and regularly allowed payments to go through without ensuring the transactions would be executed properly. Cardinal also failed to maintain complete and accurate books and records of its accounts, the SEC said. Moreover, in 2016, Cardinal China found that the marketing employees had paid government-employed health-care professionals and employees of state-owned retail companies, the SEC said. Cardinal and its subsidiary ceased payments the same year, according to the regulator. Cardinal Health divested itself of its China unit in early 2018.

The $400 million settlement will be distributed over 12 years to more than 100 counties and cities in West Virginia.
Cardinal Health said in a statement that it is committed to being a part of the solution to the opioid epidemic and that it believes the settlement ""will help provide necessary relief to West Virginia communities in need."" A representative for McKesson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month, a federal judge ruled in favor of the companies and said they couldn't be held liable for creating the opioid crisis in the West Virginia county and city.","West Virginia has reached a $400 million settlement with drug distributors McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Cardinal Health Inc., over allegations that the companies fueled the opioid epidemic in the state and created a health crisis. The settlement, reached Monday, is the latest in a wave of others over the past year, including one in which the three distributors and drug company Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay roughly $25 billion to resolve litigation brought by states. West Virginia had chosen not to participate in that earlier settlement. The $400 million settlement will be distributed over 12 years to more than 100 counties and cities in West Virginia. Bob Fitzsimmons, one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs, said the counties and cities will receive roughly double the amount they would have gotten if they hadn't pursued separate litigation with the three distributors.

Four behemoth ships were docked in the Bahamian capital's port, with more scheduled to arrive the following day, reports the News-Press, which is part of the USA TODAY Network. Yes, the capital has become a hub for hurricane helpers and displaced people since Hurricane Dorian walloped the islands Sept. 1, but it has the capacity to bend to accommodate them without breaking. Even as he begged the world to come to his countryâ€™s aid by stabilizing the climate, the Bahamian prime minister couldnâ€™t help but wax poetical about his nationâ€™s â€œnaturally warm aquamarine and jade waters. â€?Want to help?: Visit the Bahamas' to help islands recover from Hurricane Dorian In his address last week to the United Nationsâ€?general assembly, Hubert Minnis said Hurricane Dorianâ€™s devastation should serve as an urgent warning that his archipelago and all coastal communities are endangered by what he called â€œthe global climate emergency â€?the greatest challenge facing humanity. â€?Macro and micro: Climate change is shaping life choices and affecting mental health But later in the speech, Minnis made another plea to the world: â€œPlease come and visit one or more of the 14 other major islands in the Bahamas not affected by Hurricane Dorian, including Nassau on the island of New Providence,â€?he said. â€œThe revenue from tourists visiting the Bahamas will play a vital role in reconstructing and rebuilding the affected areas,â€?sentiments echoed by tourism officials throughout the island nation. A recent meeting in the luxe lobby of Paradise Island's Baha Mar resort illustrated how tourism and recovery can go together. Creative help: Bahamas bachelorette party turns into mission trip As slot machines jingled and flashed behind them, Naples couple Patty and Christina Amandis waited for Mia Campbell and family to arrive. Patty, a Naples, Florida DJ, has been coming to enjoy the Bahamas since she was a kid and estimates she's visited between 30 and 40 times. But the couple's visit to the islands last week was different: It was a mission trip. The two Naples residents traveled to the waterfront resort, just over a bridge from Nassau, to give away the more than 100 pounds of hurricane help they'd gathered in Florida and hauled to the Bahamas. In depth: Bahamas struggles to right itself a month after Category 5 Dorian brutalized islands ""We love the Bahamas and the Bahamian people, and this is our chance to give back,"" Patty said. Nassau resident Mia Campbell, originally from the hard-hit Abaco islands, tearily hugged the Amandises and assured them their help would reach those who most need it. Be like the Amandises, says the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism & Aviation, because the best way to help the islands recover is by helping them conduct their tourism business as usual. By the numbers: Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas Itâ€™s not that the Bahamas want the rest of the world to forget what happened when the Category 5 monster tore through the Abacos and Grand Bahama islands â€?itâ€™s that they want it to remember that 14 of its 16 main islands are perfectly fine and open for business. More: Dorian's legacy: The slowest, strongest hurricane to ever hit the Bahamas The commonwealthâ€™s last official census in 2010 counted 351,461 residents, with the countryâ€™s projections for 2019 at 391,000, though some organizations place that closer to 400,000. Of those, two thirds live in the capital city of Nassau (theyâ€™re known as Nassuvians) on the island of New Providence. Since the storm, those numbers have increased by as much as 10,000, but National Emergency Management Agency Director Capt. Stephen Russell said Nassuvians will make room. Like Minnis, Russel wants the world to focus on all that Nassau and the Bahamasâ€?other islands have to offer. ""We are open for business,"" he said. ""That's what the world needs to know. "" Indeed, the Bahamasâ€?recovery hinges on the success of the tourism sector â€?some 60% of Bahamas GDP, according to the Inter-American Development Bank. That number is the highest of any Caribbean nation, which is why last weekâ€™s just-inked deal with Carnival Holland America Line was such good news for the Bahamas government â€?and such a relief, considering it happened three weeks after Dorian. Bahamas help: Carnival loads Liberty cruise ship with relief supplies for hurricane victims The agreement calls for a $100 million port to be built on Grand Bahama as well as $80 million in enhancements to the companyâ€™s private Half Moon Cay, including a massive pier that will enable the island to accommodate larger ships. One of those will be Carnivalâ€™s still-under-construction Mardi Gras, the first cruise liner to be run on liquefied natural gas. The agreement shows the Bahamas are ""full speed ahead,"" Minnis said. As deputy director general of the tourism ministry, Ellison Thompson told USA TODAY earlier this month: ""The Bahamas is a country of 700 islands and cays beginning 50 miles off the Florida coast and stretching for 750 miles from Bimini in the north to Inagua in the south,"" said Thompson. ""The distance between these areas are similar to the distance between Philadelphia and New York. ""If NYC has an issue, it doesn't affect Philadelphia.

On a cruise ship.
Cruise ships are getting bigger and more popular.
Carnival, the largest cruise company, is building its largest ship, a 180,000-ton floating town three football fields long with 18 decks and even the first roller coaster at sea.
We are already dense,"" says Ben Clement, Carnival Cruise Line's senior vice president for new builds, ship refurbishment and product innovation.
The size of large rooms or cabin layout on a ship is limited by requirements for fire doors, for example.
""If you double the size of the ship, you cannot double the size of the entertainment, of the dining room."" Figuring out how to make a bigger area feel small and small spaces feel big are the challenge of many travel companies.
Most big cruise ships have a large atrium in the middle of the ship, a public square to add a feeling of openness and grandeur.
With Mardi Gras, Carnival decided to move the atrium to one side, creating a first-ever three-story glass wall with ocean views.
The strategy is to make the atrium a more useful space day and night to help disperse passengers throughout the ship.
""It's a rather large hole in the side of the ship,"" says Katja Lankinen, the principal engineer on the Mardi Gras project for Meyer Turku, the Finnish shipbuilder.
The open space meant one side of the ship would be heavier than the otherâ€”that's why atriums have traditionally been put in the center of the ship.
Mardi Gras will represent a significant step up for Carnival, one-third bigger than Carnival's current largest ship, Panorama, launched earlier this month out of Long Beach, Calif.
(Its total capacity is 8,376, including 1,700 crew members.) Carnival Corp., the Miami-based parent of Carnival, Princess, Cunard, Costa, Holland America, Seabourn and other cruise lines, won't say how much Mardi Gras will cost to build.
The company does say when Mardi Gras opened for booking, cabins were reserved for the initial sailings seven times faster than Carnival's last new class of ships, which includes Panorama.","Turku, Finland Where does replacing a nightstand with a small tray for phones give you a shower door instead of a clumsy curtain that sticks to you? On a cruise ship. Cruise ships are getting bigger and more popular. Yet even with their massive size, every little bit of space counts, especially in small cabins. Sometimes saving inches bedside allows for a significant bathroom upgrade. Cramming in as many people as possibleâ€”with at least a modicum of comfortâ€”is the major challenge of travel, whether on planes, trains, hotels or ships. Individual space is on the decline as travel companies try to boost profitability. Think of the shrunken airplane bathroom. Cruise ships, which now cost upward of $1 billion to build, present a significant challenge: Repeat customers and social media reviews are crucial to the business. So comfort for the masses actually matters, and it drives ship design. Carnival, the largest cruise company, is building its largest ship, a 180,000-ton floating town three football fields long with 18 decks and even the first roller coaster at sea. The Mardi Gras, which will sail late in 2020, will carry a maximum 6,641 passengers in 2,641 cabins. ""It's not really packing more in. We are already dense,"" says Ben Clement, Carnival Cruise Line's senior vice president for new builds, ship refurbishment and product innovation. With ships, like planes, bigger size not only allows more features but also brings more restrictions. The size of large rooms or cabin layout on a ship is limited by requirements for fire doors, for example. More weight means it takes more fuel to move, and fuel represents one of the biggest costs. A big ship still has to be fast enough to complete voyages on time. In addition, a vessel that's too large can't sail under some bridges or use certain ports. The Mardi Gras, for example, will be too big for its namesake port, New Orleans. ""You cannot put a ship in a copy machine and press size two,"" Mr. Clement says. ""If you double the size of the ship, you cannot double the size of the entertainment, of the dining room."" Figuring out how to make a bigger area feel small and small spaces feel big are the challenge of many travel companies. Carnival let me explore Mardi Gras in the shipyard where, unfinished, she reveals some of the secrets of putting 6,000 customers on a single boat and not making it feel crowded. Some spaces become multifunctional. Most big cruise ships have a large atrium in the middle of the ship, a public square to add a feeling of openness and grandeur. With Mardi Gras, Carnival decided to move the atrium to one side, creating a first-ever three-story glass wall with ocean views. At night, the atrium transforms into a show lounge for 600 to 800 people, featuring everything from acrobats walking on the glass wall with ceiling-mounted rigging to stand-up comedians and musicians. Screens can descend from the ceiling and rise from the floor to turn the atrium into a giant Super Bowl watch party. Benches and chairs, all fixed to the floor per regulation, have been designed for double duty. The strategy is to make the atrium a more useful space day and night to help disperse passengers throughout the ship. But the placement, crucial for the ocean views that Carnival hopes will make it a popular resting place during the day, became an engineering challenge. ""It's a rather large hole in the side of the ship,"" says Katja Lankinen, the principal engineer on the Mardi Gras project for Meyer Turku, the Finnish shipbuilder. The open space meant one side of the ship would be heavier than the otherâ€”that's why atriums have traditionally been put in the center of the ship. And the three-story glass wall meant little structural support in a crucial area. The solution: lighter insulation and other weight-saving moves on one side of the ship, and strengthened pillars in walls and horizontal girders in floors to compensate for the glass wall. Standing in a long line waiting for food would only cement that overcrowded feeling. To disperse hungry passengers, Carnival is strategically placing restaurants in six different neighborhoodsâ€”themed zones where it hopes people will not only go to eat but linger. That's in addition to the big, traditional seated dining room. Share Your Thoughts How appealing is the idea of a vacation on a giant cruise ship? Join the conversation below. The French Quarter, for example, will have an Emeril Lagasse bistro as well as a jazz club, street entertainers, a fortuneteller and a cooking school. It will be packed into two decks, with a portion of the upper deck cut out so you'll see people either above you or below you. ""It's more open, yet you get twice as many things in,"" says Brett Vitols, Carnival's director of new builds. Another neighborhood will have a brewery and barbecue restaurant. The brewery makes beer on board, a source of fascination for some passengers, but doesn't take up much space. The growth rate for the cruise industry tops just about anything in the travel world. Last year, 28.5 million people took a cruise, nearly 7% more than in 2017, according to the Cruise Lines International Association. The growth rate in North America was 9%. A total of 19 new ocean ships are expected to sail in 2020. CLIA says the global passenger count should reach 32 million. Some of the higher passenger numbers come with the increasing popularity of shorter cruisesâ€”three- and four-day escapes. And some has come by filling bigger boats. Royal Caribbean's Symphony of the Seas, launched last year, is the largest in the world at 228,000 tons, more than 20% bigger than Mardi Gras, with 118 more cabins. Mardi Gras will represent a significant step up for Carnival, one-third bigger than Carnival's current largest ship, Panorama, launched earlier this month out of Long Beach, Calif. The passenger capacity will be 50% larger, 6,000 compared with 4,000. (Its total capacity is 8,376, including 1,700 crew members.) Carnival Corp., the Miami-based parent of Carnival, Princess, Cunard, Costa, Holland America, Seabourn and other cruise lines, won't say how much Mardi Gras will cost to build. The company does say when Mardi Gras opened for booking, cabins were reserved for the initial sailings seven times faster than Carnival's last new class of ships, which includes Panorama. Mardi Gras will float for the first time at the end of next month. The steel is all in place and workers are installing heating and air-conditioning ductwork and electrical wiring. Cabins built in a nearby factory are being hoisted onboard intact, slid in through the side of the ship. A cabin mock-up shows a couch that folds out into a bed, an ottoman that can double both as extra storage and a table top and rounded lights and curved shapes that add to the openness. Previous cabin designs for Carnival and others used a coffee table, hard edges and recessed spotlights. PHOTO: George Downs/The Wall Street Journal Those cabins got their own Marie Kondo-type redesign. An English design firm worked to make them feel more spacious in the same square footage. Bathrooms grew, largely a result of the bedside table change to trays mounted on the wall. Instead of a coffee table in front of the couch, an Ikea-type ottoman is used. The padded top comes off to reveal additional storage space, and flips over if you want a flat tabletop. Right angles were largely eliminatedâ€”a wall enclosing the bathroom is curved to give a more open feeling. Lighting was redesigned, with large, round lamps instead of small spotlights. The closet has a pullout shoe rack and more storage space. It's Container Store at sea. ""Everything we have,"" Carnival's Mr. Vitols says, ""we try to use efficiently.""

Justice O. Peter Sherwood of the state Supreme Court in Manhattan rejected Charter's claim that Attorney General Eric Schneiderman failed to plausibly allege the company had short-changed and misled customers. He also rejected Charter's claim that federal law pre-empted the lawsuit. The Feb. 13 decision was made public on Friday. Schneiderman accused Charter's Spectrum unit, previously known as Time Warner Cable, of having systematically defrauded customers since 2012, including by creating an impression they would consistently get fast internet speeds. The attorney general said at least 640,000 subscribers signed up for high-speed plans but got slower speeds, and many subscribers could not access promised content such as Facebook , Netflix, Google's YouTube and gaming platforms. He also accused Time Warner Cable of leasing older-generation modems to 900,000 subscribers, knowing they could not generate faster internet speeds. In a statement, Spectrum spokesman John Bonomo said the company ""delivers its advertised internet speeds,"" and will continue to vigorously contest Schneiderman's claims about practices at Time Warner Cable, which Charter bought in 2016. Sherwood rejected Charter's claims that its advertising was not misleading because the company had promised to provide speeds only ""up to"" particular levels, and reasonable consumers would understand that could mean slower speeds were possible. The judge said the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals, had rejected this argument in another case where, as Schneiderman alleged, the advertised speeds were ""functionally unattainable as a result of the defendants' knowing conduct."" Sherwood said while there may have been ""literal truth"" to Charter's advertising claims, this was not a defense ""where, as here, the claims create a false 'net impression.'"" Schneiderman called the decision a ""major victory"" for consumers. He said the lawsuit, which seeks restitution and civil fines, will proceed toward a possible trial.

I'm a Comcast TV customer. Recently I saw a commercial for Comcast RISE, a grant program for small businesses affected by the pandemic. But looking at the application, we quickly learned that it's open only to minorities and, more recently, women. The only people excluded are white menâ€”which disqualified our business. This program implies that our business didn't struggle during the pandemic because of my race and sex. But we've dealt with the same issues every business has regarding the pandemic, inflation and supply-chain disruptions. We had been paying $50 a case for disposable gloves; now we pay $150 a case. Manpower has also been an issue. Our goal had been to hire employees so we wouldn't have to do most of the work ourselves. But it's hard to compete with wages larger corporations are offering. I can afford $15 an hour; big companies around Indianapolis are paying $20-plus, in addition to a $2,000 sign-on bonus, 401(k) and other benefits. It was my wife's idea to start All American Clean, and we run it together. But since we file our taxes as a single-member limited-liability company in my name, we are ineligible for Comcast's grant. If we had filed in my wife's name, we'd be eligible. But Comcast excludes any business unless a woman or minority person owns 51% or more. So even if we owned equal shares, we wouldn't be eligible because I am a white man. On Feb. 22, Comcast announced the sixth round of RISE grants to 1,300 small businesses. There have been some 8,000 recipients across 590 cities and 34 states. That's thousands of times the company has discriminated based on race and sex. Many large corporations have gone ""woke,"" but federal law still prohibits race discrimination. When I saw Comcast's grant application, I wondered why the company hadn't been sued. I had learned about the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty because it recently succeeded in federal race-discrimination cases. We filed a lawsuit in federal court on April 4. I hope Comcast opens this program to businesses that need help, regardless of skin color. I love America, hence the name of my company. Following 9/11 I joined the Indiana National Guard and served in Iraq and Bosnia. I know our country has had its ugly chapters, and getting rid of discrimination is a worthy goal. But now major institutions and corporations celebrate discrimination. I hope I can inspire others to push back. This behavior is wrong, illegal and has no place in America.

Centene Corporation,CNC,2021/6/15,"corruption, bribery, extortion and money laundering, fraud, violation of national legislation","Obamacare Stocks Rallying Supreme Court Backs Healthcare Law
The Supreme Court's decision to uphold Obamacare is fueling a rally in managed-care stocks Centene and Molina Healthcare.
However, the court didn't rule on the broader question of whether the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is officially known, could survive without a provision that required Americans to obtain health insurance or pay tax penalties.

But the sector isn't reacting with across-the-board gains, reflecting the many hurdles that insurers face despite a push by Democrats to expand access to healthcare. The Supreme Court's ruling in the case, California v. Texas, certainly comes as a relief for the sector. The justices, in a 7-2 ruling, rejected a bid by Republicans in Texas and other states to invalidate the law, concluding they didn't have standing to sue because they hadn't suffered direct injury. However, the court didn't rule on the broader question of whether the Affordable Care Act, as Obamacare is officially known, could survive without a provision that required Americans to obtain health insurance or pay tax penalties. That ""individual mandate"" was upheld in 2012 by the Supreme Court, but it died in 2017 after Congress eliminated the tax penalties in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Republican opponents have continued to challenge the ACA, arguing that without the mandate and tax penalties it is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the mandate was justified by Congress's power to authorize taxes. More on the Decision and The Markets * Case Was Third Major Challenge to Affordable Care Act * Pfizer Covid-19 Vaccine Could See Blockbuster Sales for Years * Tech Stocks Have a Good Thursday. Nasdaq Closes In on Another High. That issue remains an overhang on the sector, even as Democrats in Congress and state governments seek to expand access to healthcare through marketplace exchanges and Medicaid programs. Two of the stocks most closely associated with Obamacare were rallying on Thursday afternoon. Centene (ticker: CNC) was ahead 1.5%, and Molina (MOH) was up 2%. Other managed-care companies were trading flat to down. Private insurers are bracing for a new wave of claims for elective procedures and other health care as the pandemic winds down. And claims related to Covid-19 may persist longer than anticipated, partly because people who tested positive are reporting new health problems. The Obamacare-related plans did get a break with the Supreme Court ruling. Nearly 90% of Molina's membership comes from managing Medicaid plans, which contribute 78% of its premium revenue, followed by 8% in Marketplace plans and the remainder in managing Medicare. Centene is also a leading provider of managed Medicaid and private-marketplace plans. The company manages Medicaid in 29 states covering 13.8 million people. Centene also provides insurance through state marketplaces in 22 states, covering more than 1.9 million people. But expanding Medicaid, a cornerstone of Obamacare, remains a state-by-state battle. North Carolina, for example, is shifting two-thirds of residents to Medicaid plans managed by Centene and other insurers this summer. But other states are resisting: Oklahoma's Supreme Court recently rejected commercial Medicaid plans for its state. Missouri's Republican-controlled government has also rejected voter-approved support to expand Medicaid. That prompted Centene CEO Michael Neidorff to call the state an ""embarrassment"" in recent public comments, and threaten to abandon its headquarters in St. Louis, according to news reports. Centene issued positive forecasts for 2021 and 2022 in an investor presentation this week, reiterating earnings-per-share guidance of $5.05 to $5.35 this year. The company also gave a forecast for 2022 revenue, saying it expects $124 billion, though analysts were forecasting $124.9 billion, according to consensus estimates. Centene also highlighted some headwinds, including a resumption of state Medicaid requirements for ongoing coverage that were suspended in the pandemic. States such as California and Ohio also plan to ""carve out"" pharmacy benefits from managed-care plansâ€“a potential headwind for Centene, which is planning to acquire a pharmacy benefits company, Magellan Health, for $2.2 billion. Wall Street has mixed views on the stock. BMO Capital Markets' Matthew Borsch reiterated an Outperform rating on Thursday and increased his target for the stock price from $88 to $93. Wells Fargo also increased its target, along with Citigroup, Truist Securities, and Mizuho Securities.

Capital One,COF,2022/6/18,"human rights abuses and corporate complicity, violation of national legislation, cyberattack, negligence, privacy violations","Customers Money Stolen Zelle, Banks Refuse Pay
The next morning, Mr. Oriach, who lives in Brooklyn, said he discovered that the thief had drained $8,294 from his bank accounts at Capital One, using multiple money transfer apps including Zelle.
â€œBut none of that seems to have helped my case.â€?After The New York Times asked Capital One about Mr. Oriachâ€™s case, bank representatives said they had determined there was fraud and would repay him.
While banks argue that they shouldnâ€™t have to refund customers who inadvertently granted a scammer permission to use their accounts, they have also often been reluctant to refund customers like Mr. Oriach whose money was stolen.
Under a 1978 federal rule called Regulation E, banks are required to make clients whole if their money is stolen from a consumer account through an electronic payment initiated by another person, as in Mr. Oriachâ€™s case.
But despite the updated guidance, banks in many cases are refusing to refund customers who claim â€?often with supporting documentation â€?that money was stolen from their accounts.
â€œRegulation E was never intended for instant money movement products.â€?In early February, Chuck Ruoff said, a thief transferred his mobile phone number to another device through an attack technique called â€œSIM swapping.â€?The thief then used Mr. Ruoffâ€™s number to get into his accounts at Bank of America and extract $3,450 through Zelle.
I never authorized this,â€™â€?said Mr. Ruoff, who has been a Bank of America customer for 34 years.
Thatâ€™s a crime.â€?After The Times contacted Bank of America, it refunded Mr. Ruoffâ€™s money.
The bank was already reconsidering its decision and paid the claim after taking into account additional information provided by Mr. Ruoff, said Bill Halldin, a bank spokesman.
â€œThereâ€™s a responsibility in principle on the part of the banks,â€?Mr. Lynch said.
â€œReports of widespread fraud harming consumers on Zelle are deeply concerning, especially as its parent company and the big banks that own it fail to take responsibility,â€?said Ms. Warren, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee.
Customers have filed separate lawsuits seeking class-action status against Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo, claiming that the lenders didnâ€™t do enough to protect consumers from fraud that occurred on Zelle.
After the consumer bureau issued guidelines clarifying that Reg E covered all unauthorized person-to-person transfers â€?and after The Times called Bank of America last month about Mr. Bronsonâ€™s case â€?he got some good news.
â€œWe decided the claim based on the facts and current Regulation E guidelines, as we would any client request,â€?Mr. Halldin, the Bank of America spokesman, said.
She said she notified the bank and found that the money had been sent through Zelle to a Gmail account she didnâ€™t recognize.","Argelys Oriach was on his way home from a shopping trip one evening in March when he was robbed at gunpoint. The thief demanded his iPhone and passcode. Mr. Oriach turned them over and fled. The next morning, Mr. Oriach, who lives in Brooklyn, said he discovered that the thief had drained $8,294 from his bank accounts at Capital One, using multiple money transfer apps including Zelle. He contacted Capital One, fully expecting the bank to refund him the stolen cash, as required by federal law. The bank refunded only $250, saying it found no evidence that the rest of the money was stolen. Mr. Oriach was stunned. â€œI filed a police report, identified the suspect at a precinct and even testified at a grand jury,â€?he said. â€œBut none of that seems to have helped my case.â€?After The New York Times asked Capital One about Mr. Oriachâ€™s case, bank representatives said they had determined there was fraud and would repay him. â€œWe reached out to the customer to apologize for any additional stress this matter has caused,â€?Capital One said in an emailed statement. In recent years, payment apps like Zelle, Venmo and Cash App have become the preferred way for millions of customers to transfer money from one person to another. Last year, people sent $490 billion on Zelle, the countryâ€™s most popular payments app, and $230 billion through Venmo, its closest rival. But the same reasons that have drawn customers to these apps â€?they are free, fast and convenient â€?have made them easy targets for scammers and thieves. While banks argue that they shouldnâ€™t have to refund customers who inadvertently granted a scammer permission to use their accounts, they have also often been reluctant to refund customers like Mr. Oriach whose money was stolen. That could be a potential violation of the law. Under a 1978 federal rule called Regulation E, banks are required to make clients whole if their money is stolen from a consumer account through an electronic payment initiated by another person, as in Mr. Oriachâ€™s case. Since Reg E was written well before payment apps existed, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year issued guidelines saying that the law covered all person-to-person online payments. The bureau clarified that all unauthorized online money transfers â€?meaning any payment initiated by someone other than the customer and done without the customerâ€™s permission â€?were the bankâ€™s liability. â€œWhen a consumer provides notice to a financial institution that money was stolen from the consumerâ€™s account, the burden is on the institution to show that the transfer of funds out of the consumerâ€™s account was authorized by the consumer,â€?said Raul Cisneros, a spokesman for the bureau. But despite the updated guidance, banks in many cases are refusing to refund customers who claim â€?often with supporting documentation â€?that money was stolen from their accounts. The banks rarely provide clear explanations for their decisions, leaving victimized customers with little recourse. The consumer bureauâ€™s updated guidelines â€œcaused a lot of angst and confusion for banks,â€?said Peter Tapling, a payments consultant. â€œRegulation E was never intended for instant money movement products.â€?In early February, Chuck Ruoff said, a thief transferred his mobile phone number to another device through an attack technique called â€œSIM swapping.â€?The thief then used Mr. Ruoffâ€™s number to get into his accounts at Bank of America and extract $3,450 through Zelle. Mr. Ruoff reported the theft as soon as he discovered it, but his claim was denied. The bank said the transaction did not appear to be unauthorized. Mr. Ruoff sent the bank additional documentation, including a police report and a letter from Verizon describing what happened, and asked for the case to be reconsidered. He was told to wait 45 days for a response. When that deadline passed, he was told to keep waiting. Mr. Ruoff spent hours on the phone, calling every few days for an update on his claim. â€œI said repeatedly, â€˜Iâ€™ve never used Zelle. I never authorized this,â€™â€?said Mr. Ruoff, who has been a Bank of America customer for 34 years. â€œI said to the lady I spoke with once, do you think I would go to the police department and file a false report? Thatâ€™s a crime.â€?After The Times contacted Bank of America, it refunded Mr. Ruoffâ€™s money. The bank was already reconsidering its decision and paid the claim after taking into account additional information provided by Mr. Ruoff, said Bill Halldin, a bank spokesman. Zelle, the most popular payments app, is owned and operated by Early Warning Services, a company based in Scottsdale, Ariz. Early Warning is owned by seven banks â€?Bank of America, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, PNC, Truist, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. But each of the 1,600 banks and credit unions that offer Zelle to their customers uses its own security settings and policies. Neither the banks nor Early Warning publicly release any data on fraud, so itâ€™s hard to tell how prevalent scams and theft are on Zelle. Incidents like the ones described by Mr. Oriach and Mr. Ruoff are â€œrareâ€?and make up a small portion of the activity on the platform, said Meghan Fintland, a spokeswoman for Early Warning. In a survey of nearly 1,400 people whose accounts were accessed without their consent last year, a quarter said Zelle or other person-to-person payment services were used to make unauthorized money transfers, according to a report by Shirley Inscoe, an adviser at Aite-Novarica Group, a financial services consultant. That was second only to fraudulent credit card transactions. Bob Sullivan, a journalist and longtime consumer advocate, likened the current wave of scams and thefts â€?and the banksâ€?reluctance to absorb the losses on them â€?to the early days of online banking, when phishing and other tricks to get customersâ€?login credentials and passwords were epidemic and banks routinely denied customersâ€?claims. It took an order from the Federal Reserve in 2005 to make it clear to banks that they were expected to cover such cases. Outright theft is just one aspect of the much bigger problem of fraud on Zelle and other payments apps. In March, The Times reported that con artists and other scammers often trick people into making payments themselves â€?such as by posing as bank employees or selling fraudulent goods. In those cases, banks usually refuse to make refunds, arguing that since customers themselves initiated the transfer, itâ€™s not â€œunauthorizedâ€?under the definition of the law. Some lawmakers are beginning to take note. Asked by the House Financial Services Committee about surging online payment scams following The Times report, Rohit Chopra, the director of the consumer bureau, said it was high on the bureauâ€™s radar. â€œFraud is piling up, and itâ€™s a major problem,â€?Mr. Chopra said. Representative Stephen F. Lynch, Democrat of Massachusetts, raised concerns at that hearing about consumer protections for Zelle transfers. â€œThereâ€™s a responsibility in principle on the part of the banks,â€?Mr. Lynch said. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, recently criticized the big banks that own Zelle. â€œReports of widespread fraud harming consumers on Zelle are deeply concerning, especially as its parent company and the big banks that own it fail to take responsibility,â€?said Ms. Warren, who sits on the Senate Banking Committee. In April, she sent a scathing letter to Early Warning Services with another Democrat, Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, blasting the company and its owners for creating a â€œconfusing and unfairâ€?situation for victims. Customers have filed separate lawsuits seeking class-action status against Bank of America, Capital One and Wells Fargo, claiming that the lenders didnâ€™t do enough to protect consumers from fraud that occurred on Zelle. Wells Fargo and Capital One declined to comment. Bank of America said it disagreed with the allegations. Changing regulatory guidelines have the potential to change the outcome for victims of theft. In May 2020, Martin Bronson, an 80-year-old retiree in Florham Park, N.J., got a call from a man who claimed to be an Amazon customer service agent. Mr. Bronson gave the man access to his computer with TeamView, a remote control app. The caller then got into his Bank of America account and used Zelle to transfer $3,316. Mr. Bronson sent the bank his police report. His claim was denied. After the consumer bureau issued guidelines clarifying that Reg E covered all unauthorized person-to-person transfers â€?and after The Times called Bank of America last month about Mr. Bronsonâ€™s case â€?he got some good news. The bank refunded him the money. â€œWe decided the claim based on the facts and current Regulation E guidelines, as we would any client request,â€?Mr. Halldin, the Bank of America spokesman, said. In January, Carla Lisio, a therapist in White Plains, N.Y., discovered $4,750 missing from her checking account at Chase. She said she notified the bank and found that the money had been sent through Zelle to a Gmail account she didnâ€™t recognize. Ms. Lisio insists she did not make the transfer. The bank has repeatedly rejected her reimbursement requests, saying it found no evidence of fraud. â€œThe device used is consistent with your history, there were no new devices added and there were no invalid log in attempts,â€?the bank wrote to her in March. Ms. Lisio said she was shocked that her spotless 25-year history as a Chase customer seemed to count for nothing. â€œTheyâ€™re calling me a liar and theyâ€™re calling me a criminal, because what theyâ€™re saying is, Iâ€™m trying to steal $4,750 from the bank,â€?she said. â€œI really just want to say to them, I canâ€™t explain what happened. All I can tell you is that I didnâ€™t do this. And all youâ€™re able to tell me is that you donâ€™t believe me.â€?When The Times contacted Chase, it stuck with its decision.

        <Matched Summary>: Customers Money Stolen Zelle, Banks Refuse Pay
The next morning, Mr. Oriach, who lives in Brooklyn, said he discovered that the thief had drained $8,294 from his bank accounts at Capital One, using multiple money transfer apps including Zelle.
â€œBut none of that seems to have helped my case.â€?After The New York Times asked Capital One about Mr. Oriachâ€™s case, bank representatives said they had determined there was fraud and would repay him.
While banks argue that they shouldnâ€™t have to refund customers who inadvertently granted a scammer permission to use their accounts, they have also often been reluctant to refund customers like Mr. Oriach whose money was stolen.
Under a 1978 federal rule called Regulation E, banks are required to make clients whole if their money is stolen from a consumer account through an electronic payment initiated by another person, as in Mr. Oriachâ€™s case.
But despite the updated guidance, banks in many cases are refusing to refund customers who claim â€?often with supporting documentation â€?that money was stolen from their accounts.
â€œRegulation E was never intended for instant money movement products.â€?In early February, Chuck Ruoff said, a thief transferred his mobile phone number to another device through an attack technique called â€œSIM swapping.â€?The thief then used Mr. Ruoffâ€™s number to get into his accounts at Bank of America and extract $3,450 through Zelle.

Its shares jumped 2.6 percent to $62.76 on Tuesday.","HOUSTON, May 14 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips Chief Executive Officer Ryan Lance on Tuesday repeated a pledge to restrain spending, saying the U.S. oil producer would not be drawn into pricey mergers and acquisitions. ConocoPhillips plans to keep its capital spending at around $6 billion this year, Lance told shareholders at the company's annual meeting. ConocoPhillips has won billions of dollars in arbitration awards over the expropriation of its assets in Venezuela and posted a first-quarter profit that topped estimates. ""We're sticking to our plan,"" Lance said. Rival Occidental Petroleum Corp last week agreed to buy rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $38 billion in a deal that includes expensive financing from billionaire Warren Buffett. The deal keeps Anadarko's prime position in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico out of the grasp of Chevron Corp , which had sought to buy it for $33 billion. ""Do we wish we were larger in the Permian? Sure,"" Lance said. ""It has to be competitive in the portfolio and that's a high bar."" ConocoPhillips will continue to do small deals that add neighboring properties to its portfolio, buy royalty interests and add smaller assets - for which it spent about $1 billion last year. The company holds around 800,000 acres in the Permian Basin, including shale and conventional properties. ""The big corporate M&A that requires these very large premiums that we've seen here in the last month or so, those are very tough,"" Lance said. ""Those are hard to do. Those are destructive to value. They're destructive to returns."" The company also does not intend to wade back into deepwater Gulf of Mexico projects because they are not cost competitive, Lance said following the shareholder meeting. ""I wouldn't expect us to be going anytime soon into an area that we don't think is competitive with our current portfolio,"" Lance said.

Citgo, a PDVSA subsidiary and Venezuela's crown jewel overseas asset, is being targeted by numerous parties seeking payment from Venezuela or PDVSA. But any transfer of its ownership is currently restricted by U.S. sanctions aimed at forcing out socialist President Nicolas Maduro. The International Chamber of Commerce last year awarded ConocoPhillips $2 billion as compensation for Venezuela's 2007 takeover of its assets. Conoco said that PDVSA made some payments, but has not finished paying, giving it the right to enforce the award. In staking a claim to PDVSA's overseas assets, Conoco joins Canadian gold mining company Crystallex, which has won a $1.4 billion judgement for expropriation of its assets, and holders of PDVSA's 2020 bond, which is backed by a 50% stake in Citgo. But last week, the Treasury Department said it would block any attempt to enforce liens, judgements or arbitral awards by seizing Venezuelan property. In its filing, Conoco acknowledged that actually seizing the shares in Citgo parent PDV Holding (PDVH) would be ""more complicated,"" but argued that it should be entitled to the same treatment as Crystallex. ""The ability of any creditor to foreclose on the PDVH Shares ... may turn on the status and interpretation of sanctions, authorizations and/or licensing from the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury,"" Conoco wrote. PDVSA was about $12 million short of its required third quarter payment to Conoco and has not paid any of the required fourth quarter amount, said Conoco spokesman Daren Beaudo. Conoco disclosed in October that it had received a total of $754 million from PDVSA through the third quarter under the $2 billion settlement agreement. ""We are working closely with the U.S. government to determine the best course of action and will comply with all applicable U.S. orders, laws and regulations"" governing transactions with PDVSA, Beaudo added.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a weekend order sided with environmental and Native plaintiffs who challenged the Trump administration's go-ahead for ConocoPhillips' Willow project. Trump made oil-and-gas drilling a priority during his four-year term, but his successor, Joseph Biden, has taken several steps to restrict fossil fuel development. The Trump administration approved the Willow development plan in October. Permits to mine for gravel and build roads were issued on the morning of Jan. 20, just before Biden was sworn in as the nation's 46th president. The injunction issued Saturday night bars ConocoPhillips from conducting winter gravel mining and gravel road-building for the project while the lawsuit is ongoing. Willow holds 590 million barrels of recoverable oil and could produce up to 160,000 barrels per day as soon as 2024, according to ConocoPhillips' previous estimates. Located on federal land in the National Petroleum Reserve of Alaska, Willow would be the North Slope's westernmost producing oil field. The 9th Circuit Court order followed a Feb. 6 lower-court order that briefly paused construction. Both orders concluded that ConocoPhillips' gravel work would cause irreparable environmental harm. Because most North Slope oilfield construction is limited to winter, the appeals court's injunction likely precludes construction until at least January, said Bridget Psarianos, an attorney with Trustees for Alaska, the environmental law firm representing the plaintiffs. ""We are grateful that the court has put a stop to destructive on-the-ground construction and blasting work while our lawsuit makes its way through court,"" SiqiÃ±iq Maupin, executive director of Sovereign IÃ±upiat for a Living Arctic, said in a statement released by Trustees for Alaska.

The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in a weekend order sided with environmental and Native plaintiffs who challenged the Trump administration's go-ahead for ConocoPhillips' Willow project.
        
        The court determined that the project would have significant impacts on the communities and landscapes in the area, as well as on the health of the indigenous people. These impacts were not adequately addressed in the environmental impact statement prepared by the Trump administration, which approved the project.
        
        The court also noted that the project would have a disproportionate impact on the indigenous people, who rely on the land for their livelihood and cultural practices. The project would also have a negative impact on the landscapes in the area, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which is a treasured natural heritage site.
        
        The court therefore concluded that the project should not proceed until a comprehensive environmental impact statement has been prepared that adequately addresses the impacts on the communities, landscapes, health of the indigenous people, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
        
        In summary, the appeals court has blocked the construction of the ConocoPhillips Alaska project due to the significant impacts it would have on the communities, landscapes, health of the indigenous people, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

To be sure, it is not clear whether the FTC will seek to block any of the energy deals it has subjected to second requests.","(Fixes reference to Shell/ConocoPhillips deal in penultimate paragraph) By David French and Diane Bartz NEW YORK/WASHINGTON, Oct 21 (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust regulators have extended the approval process for at least five oil and gas mergers and acquisitions in the last three months, as President Joe Biden's administration scrutinizes deals in a bid to tackle soaring energy prices, according to regulatory filings and corporate lawyers. The slowdown comes amid growing pressure on policymakers to respond to consumer angst over skyrocketing retail gasoline prices, as U.S. crude futures hit multi-year highs. The White House has been calling U.S. oil and gas producers to ask how they can help lower prices, Reuters reported last week https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/white-house-asks-us-oil-and-gas-companies-help-lower-fuel-costs-sources-2021-10-13. The move is also emblematic of a new push by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to protect consumers, workers, the environment and society at large. Under its new chair Lina Khan, the antitrust regulator has taken a tough stance on deals ranging from technology to healthcare. Such scrutiny is rare in the oil and gas sector, where deals typically sail past regulators, more than a dozen industry sources, including lawyers and bankers advising on energy deals, said in interviews. This is because these companies sell their output to a global market, and regional consolidation has no impact on energy prices dictated by supply and demand worldwide. Maureen Ohlhausen, chair of antitrust & competition law at Baker Botts LLP, who served as acting FTC chair from January 2017 until April 2018 under the previous Trump administration, called the scrutiny unprecedented. ""Even though previous Democratic FTC commissioners wanted active enforcement, the industry was told what the standards were, deals got reviewed and things moved along. This is really different,"" Ohlhausen said. ""I believe the FTC Chair, effectively, would like to deter mergers."" An FTC spokesperson declined to comment. The FTC is subjecting more deals to so-called second requests, seeking additional information and documents, the deal advisers said and the filings show. Second requests can delay regulatory clearance of deals by several months. ""I am aware of two mergers in the last couple of months where FTC staff did not see a need to issue a second request but were overruled by their management,"" said Darren Tucker, chair of the antitrust practice at law firm Vinson & Elkins LLP. He declined to name the two deals. Among the proposed transactions that received second requests in September were HollyFrontier Corp's $2.6 billion purchase of Sinclair Oil and Vertex Energy Inc's $140 million sale of motor oil collection and recycling assets to Safety-Kleen Systems Inc, the regulatory filings show. Private equity firm EnCap Investments' proposed $1.5 billion acquisition of oil and gas producer EP Energy also received a second request in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the matter. EnCap and EP Energy did not respond to comment requests. Sources indicated there were other transactions which have received second requests in recent weeks but declined to identify them. Second requests involving oil and gas producers are rare, and it is more common for the FTC to scrutinize deals involving pipelines and gas stations. Pipeline operator Energy Transfer LP said in May it received a second request on its proposed $7.2 billion takeover of Enable Midstream Partners LP. DEALMAKING RISKS The FTC's scrutiny threatens to put the brakes on dealmaking in the oil patch, which had already dropped to $18.5 billion of mergers and acquisitions between U.S. oil and gas producers in the third quarter, down from $33.4 billion in the second quarter, according to data analytics firm Enverus. The White House has been public with its requests for the FTC to act as the reopening of economies around the world in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic drives up energy consumption. Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, wrote to FTC Chair Khan in August asking her to investigate https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Letter-to-Director-Deese-National-Economic-Council.pdf soaring energy prices. Khan responded that the FTC will scrutinize consolidation among gas station operators, but also look at dealmaking in the energy industry more broadly. The Biden White House has already irked the oil and gas industry by making climate change a priority in its administrative agenda. It temporarily halted the issuance of new leases for drilling on federal land and has proposed to end some fossil fuel subsidies. Energy companies argue these moves will push up energy costs. To be sure, it is not clear whether the FTC will seek to block any of the energy deals it has subjected to second requests. The regulator has not challenged a major merger of oil and gas producers since BP Plc's $27 billion acquisition of Atlantic Richfield Co in 2000. It sued to block the merger and only agreed to drop its objections after BP offered to divest oil production acreage in Alaska. A major test for the FTC will be ConocoPhillips' proposed $9.5 billion acquisition of Royal Dutch Shell Plc's Permian Basin assets. It was announced last month, and any FTC second request would be made in the coming weeks. Shell and ConocoPhillips declined comment.

To be sure, it is not clear whether the FTC will seek to block any of the energy deals it has subjected to second requests.

Energy exploration and production giant ConocoPhillips (ticker: COP) said it will pay an ordinary dividend of 46 cents a share and a second-quarter variable return of cash of 30 cents a share. That's a 50% increase from the previous variable return of cash of 20 cents a share. Due to the volatility companies, more energy companies have been embracing variable dividends as a way to manage their return of capital to shareholders through an economic cycle. ConocoPhillips stock yields 2%. It had a one-year return of nearly 120% as of Thursday's close, dividends included, compared with about 19% for the S&P 500. CME Group (CME), whose portfolio includes a variety of futures and options products, declared a quarterly dividend of $1 a share, up from 90 cents previously. The company has regularly paid a special dividend, most recently last month when it distributed $3.25 a share. The stock has a one-year return of about 30%, and it yields 1.5%. Insurer and asset manager Prudential Financial (PRU) is raising its quarterlypayout to $1.20 a share, increase of 5 cents, or about 4%, from $1.15. The stock, which yields 4.1%, has a one-year return of around 47%. Cigna (CI) is planning to boost its quarterly dividend by 12%, or 12 cents, to $1.12 a share from $1. The health-services company's stock, which yields 2.1%, has a one-year return of about 1%. Air Products & Chemicals (APD), which supplies industrial gases and related equipment, declared a quarterly payout of $1.62 a share, an increase of 8% from $1.50. The stock, whose one-year return is about 4%, yields 2.5%. This marks the 40th straight year in which the company has raised its quarterly dividend. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) declared a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a share from 33 cents for an increase of 15%. The stock, which yields 1.2%, has a one-year return of about 12%. Its various businesses include the New York Stock Exchange. Bath & Body Works (BBWI) said it plans to pay a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share, up from 15 cents for a boost of 33%. That equates to an annual dividend of 80 cents a share versus 60 cents currently. The stock, which has a one-year turn of about 58%, yields 1.4%. Corning (GLW), which makes specialty glass, ceramics, and fiber, is planning to boosts its quarterly dividend to 27 cents a share, a 12.5% increase from 24 cents. The stock, which yields 2.6%, has returned about 20% in the past year. Meanwhile, January was a pretty busy month for S&P 500 dividend increases, though it trailed such activity in the corresponding period of 2020 before the pandemic took hold. S&P Dow Jones Indices recorded 33 dividend hikes last month for companies in the index. That compares with 33 dividend increases in January 2021, 41 in January 2020, and 36 in January 2019. Several stood out in the latest January for the size of their increases. The board of Tractor Supply (TSCO), which operates more than 2,000 stores catering to customers in rural areas, declared a quarterly dividendof 92 cents a share, up 40 cents, or nearly 80%, from 52 cents currently. This past week, United Parcel Service (UPS) was pretty aggressive as well, declaring a quarterly dividendof $1.52 a share, a boost of nearly 50% from $1.02 and the largest quarterly dividend boost in the shipper's history. Clearly, UPS is bullish on its prospects, high inflation, and supply-chain headwinds notwithstanding. Analysts polled by FactSet expect the company to earn an adjusted $12.79 a share this year, up about 5% from 12.13 in 2021, so the dividend is set to grow a lot faster than the earnings are this year. A review of several analysts' takes on the latest earnings results did not reveal any concerns about the dividend being too aggressive, however. ""Disciplined capital deployment, improved free cash flow and , and balance sheet improvement put UPS on more solid footing and benefit valuation,"" observed BMO Research note this week.

The agreement to supply gas for hydrogen, a potential clean fuel for electricity production, marks a new avenue for natural gas producers. Several companies, including Conoco, have lined up long-term supply contracts with liquefied natural gas (LNG) developers that supply utilities. A study to determine the hydrogen project's feasibility could be complete by year-end, according to JERA, the Japanese gas and electricity firm behind the plant. It aims to produce hydrogen from natural gas and convert it into exportable ammonia for sale in the U.S., Europe and Asia. â€œJERA and ConocoPhillips will be a low-cost ammonia supplier to domestic and international markets,"" said JERA Americas Chief Executive Steven Winn. The plant could be in operation within five to eight years at a site along the U.S. Gulf Coast. A Conoco spokesman declined to discuss the company's role in the project and the size of any potential investment. The oil and gas firm has outlined investments in multi-billion-dollar U.S. and Qatari LNG projects. It also is evaluating a carbon capture facility for a LNG plant being developed by electricity and gas provider Sempra. JERA Americas, a U.S. arm of JERA, said the company, Germany's Uniper SE and ConocoPhillips aim to initially produce 2 million tonnes of ammonia per year and could expand to 8 mtpa. Ammonia typically is used to make fertilizers but offers a low-carbon fuel that could be burned to produce electricity.

Not even the Spam was spared. AIG (ticker: AIG) dramatically cut investments in General Mills (ticker: GIS), Coca-Cola (KO), Campbell Soup (CPB), and Spam maker Hormel Foods (HRL) in the third quarter. The insurer disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. AIG didn't respond to a request for comment. Its U.S.-traded investments totaled $18.8 billion as of Sept. 30. According to SEC filings, the sales are by far the sharpest reductions in these holdings AIG has made this year. General Mills, Coca-Cola, Campbell, and Hormel all underperformed the market in the first nine months of 2021, with a 1.7% gain, 4.3% drop, 13.5% drop, and 12% drop, respectively. For comparison, the S&P 500 index rose 15% in the first nine months. Interestingly, AIG stock itself left all those stocks and the index in the dust, surging 45% in that period. It's been a bit of a reversal so far in the fourth quarter. AIG stock is down 1%. Meanwhile, General Mills, Coca-Cola, Campbell, and Hormel are sporting respective gains of 8.3%, 7.3%, 3.2%, and 12%.

General Mills reported a strong fiscal first quarter near the end of September. It's set to report fiscal-second-quarter earnings on Dec. 21 before the market opens. At the end of November, Credit Suisse analyst Robert Moskow wrote in a research report that General Mills sales were up 5% in the latest four weeks.

Coterra,CTRA,2022/11/16,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, fracking, greenhouse gas emissions","Fracking Company Featured 'Gasland' Pleads Contest Criminal Pollution Charges Pennsylvania; Coterra Energy accused causing methane migrate water supplies rural Dimock, featured documentary
A natural-gas drilling company pleaded no contest Tuesday to criminal charges related to the contamination of drinking water in a rural Pennsylvania town more than a decade ago.
Coterra Energy Inc. entered the plea in Susquehanna County Court, two years after the Pennsylvania attorney general charged its predecessor, Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., with 15 criminal counts for allegedly causing flammable methane to leak from natural-gas wells into residential water supplies in Dimock, Pa. The company also agreed to pay $16.29 million for the construction of a new public water system.
Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said Coterra ""took full responsibility for the crimes Cabot committed."" ""Residents of Dimock have waited far too long for the clean water Pennsylvania's Constitution is supposed to guarantee to all of us,"" said Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat elected earlier this month to become the state's next governor.
In 2010, the DEP found that Cabot Oil & Gas was responsible for allowing methane to migrate to water wells for 19 homes in Dimock, including one that had exploded a year earlier.
According to a grand jury presentment, Cabot Oil & Gas leased mineral rights from residents in Dimock beginning in 2006, and shortly after natural-gas drilling began residents complained about changes to their drinking water, including discoloration and foul odors.
After the Pennsylvania DEP found that Cabot's drilling had caused methane to migrate to water wells of 19 homes, the company agreed to a consent order in which it stopped new drilling over a 9-square-mile area that included those homes.","A natural-gas drilling company pleaded no contest Tuesday to criminal charges related to the contamination of drinking water in a rural Pennsylvania town more than a decade ago. Coterra Energy Inc. entered the plea in Susquehanna County Court, two years after the Pennsylvania attorney general charged its predecessor, Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., with 15 criminal counts for allegedly causing flammable methane to leak from natural-gas wells into residential water supplies in Dimock, Pa. The company also agreed to pay $16.29 million for the construction of a new public water system. The company will provide bottled water while the water system is under construction and pay water bills for between 18 and 20 homes for 75 years, according to prosecutors. Coterra said it worked with prosecutors ""to resolve historical matters and create a path forward for all parties."" The company said it strives to follow best practices and exceed industry standards. It previously had maintained that the methane in residents' wells was naturally occurring. Dimock, a small community in the northeast corner of the state, gained national attention when the 2010 documentary ""Gasland"" showed residents lighting their tap water on fire. Under state law, a plea of no contest, or ""nolo contendere,"" means the company accepts the criminal conviction, but the plea can't be used as an admission of guilt in a separate civil proceeding. Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said Coterra ""took full responsibility for the crimes Cabot committed."" ""Residents of Dimock have waited far too long for the clean water Pennsylvania's Constitution is supposed to guarantee to all of us,"" said Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat elected earlier this month to become the state's next governor. Since unconventional gas drilling, known as fracking, took off in the late 2000s in Pennsylvania and neighboring states to tap the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale formations, the Dimock case has been among those cited most often to highlight the risks to local drinking water. In 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency said fracking can affect drinking water supplies in certain circumstances, but that the number of identified cases of contamination was small. The agency cited surface spills and instances where the cement casing of a well was poor as potential causes. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection website lists 392 private water supplies that have been impacted by oil and gas activities since 2008. The list includes both conventional and unconventional drilling, and impacts range from a reduction in water to an increase in pollutants such as methane. In 2010, the DEP found that Cabot Oil & Gas was responsible for allowing methane to migrate to water wells for 19 homes in Dimock, including one that had exploded a year earlier. Cabot reached a settlement with some residents in 2012, but the suit continued. A federal judge overturned a $4.24 million jury award in 2017. The state attorney general filed criminal charges in 2020. For more than a decade, some residents who said they didn't trust their well water have relied on buying bottled water, or bought water commercially in bulk or else gathered it from creeks and artesian wells. Pennsylvania American Water says it plans to deliver water to Dimock residents through a project developed with the attorney general's office. The company said the project will include a treatment system that will eliminate contaminants in the area's groundwater and disconnect residents' plumbing from existing wells to avoid cross-contamination. According to a grand jury presentment, Cabot Oil & Gas leased mineral rights from residents in Dimock beginning in 2006, and shortly after natural-gas drilling began residents complained about changes to their drinking water, including discoloration and foul odors. Residents became more concerned after one water well exploded in 2009, according to the grand-jury report. At the time, Cabot denied responsibility for the explosion but began installing vents to residents' water wells to help remove methane. After the Pennsylvania DEP found that Cabot's drilling had caused methane to migrate to water wells of 19 homes, the company agreed to a consent order in which it stopped new drilling over a 9-square-mile area that included those homes. Some residents who had methane in their drinking water experienced rashes, dizziness, vision problems and difficulty breathing, according to the grand-jury report. Residents also reported losses in the value of their property, the report said. Ray Kemble, a 67-year-old Dimock resident, said he has been driving 24 miles round trip every week to fill a 250-gallon truck with water from a hydrant in the county seat of Montrose. He said he and another Dimock resident each pay the water utility about $50 a month for the water. Mr. Kemble said his well water had turned brown and began to smell in 2009, shortly after Cabot began drilling near his home. He said his tap water at the time also contained high enough levels of methane that he could ignite it. ""We haven't had water in 14 years,"" he said. ""I'm just trying to get peace in my life.""

Cognizant's share price fell 13.3% on Sept. 30, 2016, after the Teaneck, New Jersey-based company said it was looking into bribery allegations, and whether there were violations of the federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The defendants, including former president Gordon Coburn and former chief legal officer Steven Schwartz, denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Cognizant said it expected insurers to cover a substantial majority of the settlement payment. In February 2019, Cognizant agreed to pay $25 million to settle a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil probe. U.S. prosecutors also charged Coburn and Schwartz that month with FCPA and other violations. Those criminal cases remain pending. Lawyers for Coburn and Schwartz did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The biggest global agriculture companies are competing on a new front: enticing farmers to join programs that keep atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide in the soil.

""The idea was to get something that farmers feel comfortable with and certain of so they can have a line of sight in terms of how much money they can make,"" said Leo Bastos, head of Bayer's carbon business.
Nutrien expects to make a profit from the start, because enrolment involves selling farmers high-margin products like crop treatments composed of insect-killing bacteria or controlled-release fertilizer, said Mark Thompson, the company's Chief Strategy and Sustainability officer.
Brazil and India, where farmers harvest multiple crops each year, could generate larger volumes of sequestered carbon than the United States under Yara's program in as little as three years, said Alex Bell, chief executive of the program, called Agoro Carbon Alliance.
Agoro has an edge over some competitors because it is signing farmers to longer contracts, ten years, that should yield higher prices for their carbon, Bell said.
The programs' principle is ""essentially unworkable,"" because carbon sequestration is not permanent, especially in a warming climate, Canada's National Farmers Union said in a submission to the Canadian government.","WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CHICAGO, Oct 25 (Reuters) - The biggest global agriculture companies are competing on a new front: enticing farmers to join programs that keep atmosphere-warming carbon dioxide in the soil. Fertilizer producers Nutrien Ltd and Yara, agribusiness giant Cargill Inc, and seed and chemical dealers Corteva Inc and Bayer AG are paying growers for every acre of land dedicated to trapping carbon underground, known as sequestering it. The companies' ambitions stretch from the United States to Canada, Brazil, Europe and India, executives told Reuters. Farmers capture carbon by planting off-season crops, tilling the ground less and using fertilizer more efficiently. They log their practices on digital platforms to generate a carbon credit. Agricultural companies use the credits to offset the climate impact of other parts of their businesses or sell them to companies looking to reduce their own carbon footprints. Agriculture covers nearly 40% of the world's land and is responsible for 17% of global emissions, according to the United Nations. Changes to farm practices could sequester as much as 250 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually in the United States, or 4% of the country's emissions, according to a 2019 report https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25259/negative-emissions-technologies-and-reliable-sequestration-a-research-agenda by the National Academy of Sciences. Agriculture is therefore increasingly seen as a potential ally as companies and governments attempt to meet lower greenhouse gas emission targets and fight global warming. Some farmers view the programs run by the giant agricultural corporations with suspicion - as a method to harvest their data that will be used to sell them more products, according to interviews with more than a dozen farmers, analysts and farm groups. Other critics question whether it is even possible for farmers to guarantee they are keeping carbon underground because simply turning the soil can undo efforts to store it. Sequestering carbon, however, can provide a new revenue stream for farmers looking to diversify in a volatile industry. The farming techniques required by such programs offer the additional promise of realizing higher yields from healthier soils that are less reliant on chemicals. Hoping to be rewarded for reducing tillage and planting a cover crop on his central Illinois farm, Matt Tracy enrolled 548 acres in Cargill's RegenConnect program, choosing it over a similar one offered by Bayer due to its short, single-season contract term. He remains happy with his decision even after Bayer, whose program requires a 10-year commitment, began offering sign-up bonuses of up to $1,000. ""I didn't want to be tied up for too many years in a contract ... I want to see how it goes before I jump in whole-hog,"" he said. ""I think these programs could become more and more popular and we're going to get paid more than we are now."" Agriculture companies can measure success through the number of acres farmers devote to their programs and commitments from other corporations to eventually buy the credits generated, said Alejandro Plastina, associate professor in economics at Iowa State University. Most of the corporate commitments are vague, however, and the acres in pilot projects remain small, he said. For little cost, agriculture companies get to showcase their social responsibility, while securing farmers' loyalty to their digital platforms that can turn into greater farm supply sales down the road, Plastina said. ""It gives (ag companies) the opportunity to associate their brands with caring for the world,"" Plastina said. ""I don't expect them to make money on these projects anytime soon."" EARLY LEADERS Bayer is an early leader with around 1.5 million acres enrolled in sustainable agriculture programs globally, mostly in the United States. Bayer's program is unique in that it compensates growers for planting cover crops and reducing tillage, rather than paying them for how many tonnes of verified carbon they sequester. ""The idea was to get something that farmers feel comfortable with and certain of so they can have a line of sight in terms of how much money they can make,"" said Leo Bastos, head of Bayer's carbon business. Nutrien's program has secured 200,000 acres in the United States and Canada this year. Nutrien expects to make a profit from the start, because enrolment involves selling farmers high-margin products like crop treatments composed of insect-killing bacteria or controlled-release fertilizer, said Mark Thompson, the company's Chief Strategy and Sustainability officer. Such products also generate higher yields for farmers, Thompson said. Cargill aims to reduce its supply-chain emissions 30% by 2030 in part by enrolling 10 million acres in small-scale regenerative agriculture programs. Corteva's partnership with farm technology and services provider Indigo Ag rewards farmers for better crop nutrient management, which could encourage purchases of products such as nitrogen stabilizers, which make more efficient use of fertilizer. ""Corteva sees that as a way to deepen their relationship"" with farmers, said Chris Harbourt, Indigo's global head of carbon. Norway-based Yara is running a pilot program on 50,000 U.S. acres and plans to have 1 million U.S. acres under contract by year-end. Brazil and India, where farmers harvest multiple crops each year, could generate larger volumes of sequestered carbon than the United States under Yara's program in as little as three years, said Alex Bell, chief executive of the program, called Agoro Carbon Alliance. Agoro has an edge over some competitors because it is signing farmers to longer contracts, ten years, that should yield higher prices for their carbon, Bell said. ""It's a tough thing to ask of farmers, but that's what (credit) buyers actually value,"" Bell said. With the average U.S. farmer nearing retirement age, some are reluctant to lock in long-term, he said. Yara is launching its program at a loss and may break even within three years, Bell said. Farmers, however, give the programs mixed reviews. ""I smell complete bullshit - it's a terrible idea,"" said Manitoba farmer Gunter Jochum, president of the Western Canadian Wheat Growers Association. In return for small payments to farmers, ag companies gain access to valuable data, he said. The programs' principle is ""essentially unworkable,"" because carbon sequestration is not permanent, especially in a warming climate, Canada's National Farmers Union said in a submission to the Canadian government. But North Dakota farmer Justin Topp decided to give carbon farming a try. He committed 12,000 acres, or 80% of his land to Nutrien's program, choosing it over four others. ""Everybody's talking about it. I'm curious about what shakes out.""

The FTC says two companies used rebate programs to block competitors from selling cheaper generic insecticides and other chemicals to farmers.

The suit filed late Thursday in U.S. District Court in North Carolina alleged that Swiss seed and pesticide maker Syngenta Group and U.S.-based Corteva Inc. used rebate programs to block competitors from selling cheaper generic insecticides and other chemicals to farmers. The FTC alleged in the suit that the companies offer discounts to distributors, as long as the distributors limit their purchases of competing generic pesticides beneath a certain threshold. As a result, the suit alleged, farmers' costs have been inflated by hundreds of millions of dollars a year. ""These giants have deprived farmers of cheaper and more innovative options,"" said FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan. The FTC's suit aims to end the rebate programs used by the companies, and seeks monetary relief. The attorneys general of 10 states joined in the suit. Corteva and Syngenta both said they plan to fight the lawsuit. A Corteva spokesman said the company's marketing programs are fully compliant with antitrust laws. ""We are confident that we will prevail in this litigation,"" he said. ""This case threatens the pro-competitive investments that Corteva makes."" A Syngenta spokesman said loyalty programs offered to distributors work to the benefit of farmers by offering discounts, and that the programs are standard in the industry. The FTC's suit against the crop chemical makers was partly motivated by the high prices farmers are paying for supplies, and as the global food supply remains tight following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, said an FTC official. The companies' use of loyalty programs limits generic manufacturers' access to the traditional distribution channel, the suit said. American farmers this year have been paying significantly higher prices for weed-killing chemicals, crop seeds, fertilizer, equipment repairs and seasonal labor. Crop seed and chemical suppliers such as Corteva and rival Bayer AG have been raising prices on products sold to farmers to offset their own rising costs, company executives have said. Companies like Bayer, Syngenta and Corteva develop and patent the active ingredients that enable pesticides to kill weeds and destructive bugs. The FTC's lawsuit comes as the Biden administration has pushed to curb the power of large agriculture companies, accusing them of using their size to raise costs for consumers while underpaying farmers. Agriculture industry officials have denied this, saying that prices reflect market forces that have arisen from persistent supply-chain problems and labor shortages. Some industry groups have said they are being made a scapegoat for inflation. The U.S. Justice and Agriculture departments have largely focused on the meat and poultry industries in the past year. The agencies' actions include funding more competition at the plant level, which government officials have said will help farmers and consumers, and a proposal to change how poultry companies pay their farmers. Cargill Inc. and the newly formed Wayne-Sanderson Farms this summer agreed to pay $85 million to settle claims they violated antitrust laws by sharing information about poultry workers' wages. The Justice Department launched a civil probe into human resources practices at chicken companies earlier this year. The Department's antitrust efforts were dealt a setback earlier this year after five chicken company officials were acquitted following three attempts to win a conviction on charges that they conspired to fix prices.

CVS in May said lower-than-expected vaccine uptake meant the company would see a slightly smaller boost to prescription volume.
""The big question was always, 'Was the drugstore model in secular decline?' and most people said, 'Yes.'"" Before the pandemic, CVS and Walgreens were struggling with woes both shared and individual.
Executives of CVS and Walgreens said the pandemic was costing them hundreds of millions in lost revenue and added expense.
The chains agreed with U.S. officials to waive copays on services such as Covid-19 testing and virtual doctor's visits, while CVS paused conversions of drugstores into health hubs and Walgreens halted its cost-cutting program.
By late 2020, CVS and Walgreens were testing people at thousands of U.S. locations while working with federal health officials on a plan to vaccinate residents and workers at long-term-care facilities.
Walgreens, in raising its annual forecast in March, said money made from administering Covid-19 vaccines should begin to offset pandemic-related losses.
CVS, which has said the vaccines are more profitable than a typical prescription, has said it expects Covid-19 products and services to add about $400 million in revenue this year to the company's retail unit that includes prescriptions.
In the year's first quarter, pharmacy revenue was up 3.5%, in part due to Covid-19, the company said.","As the Covid-19 pandemic bore down last spring, America's drugstore giants warned investors that the health crisis threatened their already tenuous turnarounds. CVS Health Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. lost revenue as shoppers stayed home and skipped routine medical care. The companies spent hundreds of millions of dollars to roll out testing and vaccination programs. This spring, something changed: Covid-19 turned into a moneymaker. The nation's largest retail pharmacy chains say consumers coming for vaccines are spending money in stores. Some vaccine recipients are switching their prescriptions to the chain where they got their shots. CVS, for instance, said it expects a 2% bump this year in so-called front-store sales, which don't include prescriptions, at locations offering vaccines. The chains have launched a string of products, including at-home test kits, at-home antibody tests, and Covid-19 tests for people with no symptoms or exposureâ€”for which companies generally collect out-of-pocket fees. U.S. employers are paying for return-to-work programs, in which retail pharmacies charge thousands of dollars to vaccinate workers to facilitate staffing of offices and factories. ""One thing has become crystal clear during the past year of the pandemic: The importance of the pharmacy providing healthcare in the whole community,"" Alexander Gourlay, Walgreens co-chief operating officer, said in March as the company lifted its annual forecast, citing revenue from shots and Covid-19 tests and higher vaccine reimbursement rates. Vaccines have become more lucrative. The amount that the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pay pharmacies and other providers rose this spring to $40 for each dose, up from $28 for a single dose and $45 for two doses. Now for the required two doses for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, CVS and Walgreens are getting nearly double what they were getting before. Shots are free to the public. A variety of industriesâ€”from videoconferencing services, to makers of household goods to workout-equipment manufacturersâ€”benefited from booming demand amid the pandemic. CVS and Walgreens, which dominate the retail pharmacy landscape with nearly 20,000 U.S. locations between them, have experienced a wrenching transformation. The two chains headed into the pandemic with sagging share prices, CEOs under fire and questions around the companies' ability to compete with a growing number of online rivals. Nearly 18 months after the U.S. recorded its first Covid-19 case, the companies say testing and vaccination against the disease have contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and are beginning to outweigh the costs of managing the business through the pandemic. CVS shares are up 24% and Walgreens shares are up 34% so far this year, both outpacing the broader market. Demand for the vaccine remains a big variable. CVS in May said lower-than-expected vaccine uptake meant the company would see a slightly smaller boost to prescription volume. Walgreens said its financial forecasts are based on giving between 26 million and 34 million vaccines in its fiscal year ending Aug. 31. The companies anticipate bumps in vaccination demand from recently eligible 12- to 15-year-olds and from booster shots, which could become recommended later this year or in 2022. Other factors have bolstered the two companies. CVS says benefits from its 2018 acquisition of health insurer Aetna are beginning to show, while Walgreens has slashed costs and launched an array of strategic partnerships. Within the past year, both companies have ushered in new chief executives. ""A few years ago, they were a mess,"" said Ari Singh, an analyst at mutual-fund giant Neuberger Berman, which invests in CVS. ""The big question was always, 'Was the drugstore model in secular decline?' and most people said, 'Yes.'"" Before the pandemic, CVS and Walgreens were struggling with woes both shared and individual. They faced competition from Amazon.com Inc. and were under pressure to respond to the e-commerce giant's foray into the online pharmacy business. They also were getting squeezed by smaller profits on the sale of generic drugs. The companies each tried to alter course with deals, Walgreens by buying nearly 2,000 Rite Aid stores and CVS with its $69 billion acquisition of Aetna. The companies also pinned their futures to the concept of a health hub, in which drugstores would become places where patients go to seek medicine, consultations and lab tests to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Walgreens, in a $1 billion deal with startup VillageMD, is attaching doctors offices to hundreds of drugstores. Meantime in 2020, for the first time in decades, the largest U.S. drugstore chainsâ€”CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid Corp.â€”reduced their collective store count, ending years of expansion that had flooded U.S. cities with pharmacies. ""Changes were coming. What Covid did was hyperspeed up the process,"" said Syed Husain, managing director of the pharmacy business at advisory firm P.J. Solomon. The first U.S. Covid-19 test, developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cleared for emergency use by federal regulators, launched in January. Within a few months, CVS and Walgreens had started testing at a handful of locations with a plan, brokered with the Trump administration, to expand into pharmacies across the country. The companies raced to add sites, at times struggling with lab backlogs and massive demand in hard-hit areas. Executives of CVS and Walgreens said the pandemic was costing them hundreds of millions in lost revenue and added expense. The chains agreed with U.S. officials to waive copays on services such as Covid-19 testing and virtual doctor's visits, while CVS paused conversions of drugstores into health hubs and Walgreens halted its cost-cutting program. All the while the companies jockeyed with each other and with their smaller rivals to claim a bigger role in the nation's pandemic efforts even if it added significant costs.

By late 2020, CVS and Walgreens were testing people at thousands of U.S. locations while working with federal health officials on a plan to vaccinate residents and workers at long-term-care facilities.

CVS Health,CVS,2022/10/8,"fraud, violation of national legislation","Post-Roe, non-pregnant people denied medications 'hypothetical' babies
The nation's two largest pharmacies, Walgreens and CVS, have updated their company policies to allow their pharmacists to deny medication to people who they think could be circumventing new abortion laws by causing a miscarriage.
Wade, people with no plans, ability or wish to be pregnant have been denied necessary medications by Walgreens pharmacists worried about breaking legal restrictions on abortion, say women's advocacy groups like Global Healthy Living Foundation, a chronic illness association.
What customers should know: Walgreens, CVS pharmacists are withholding medications for people post-Roe. Patients say they feel discriminated against and should be trusted when they say they are not pregnant and don't plan to be.
Walgreens allows pharmacists to use their professional discretion when prescribing medication that could run contrary to local prohibitions on abortion, said Fraser Engerman, a spokesperson for Walgreens Boots Alliance, the owner of the pharmacy chain, which has over 9,000 drugstore locations in the U.S., ""Our pharmacists are allowed to use professional judgment when determining the legality of a prescription based on state law,"" he told USA TODAY.
Engerman said that pharmacists have been applying even more scrutiny to possible miscarriage- or birth defect-inducing medications since the Dobbs decision by the Supreme Court in June.
Mike DeAngelis, executive director for corporate communications at CVS, said the company requires its pharmacists to confirm a medication will not be used to terminate a pregnancy before it will fill a drug.
""To help ensure patients have quick and easy access to medications, providers are strongly encouraged to include their diagnosis on the prescriptions they write."" The American Medical Association, American Pharmacists Association and several other pharmacy groups put out a statement in September urging state policymakers to examine their state abortion laws to ensure that access to necessary medication and patient care are protected.
But pharmacist denials have been affecting people who have no plans to become pregnant, and doctors and pharmacists have denied medications to teens because the drugs could harm hypothetical pregnancies, according to several women's health and chronic disease advocacy groups, including the Global Healthy Living Foundation.
BOYCOTTS SPREAD: CVS Pharmacy has similar policy to Walgreens, allows pharmacists to deny birth control prescriptions HOW TO GET BIRTH CONTROL: What to do if CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy, refuses to fill your birth control People denied medication in case they might become pregnant The fallout from the Supreme Court's decision has created vast uncertainty among medical providers in some states as legislatures pass more restrictive abortion laws.
Doctors and health advocates say the vagueness of many of the state laws banning abortion is leading prescribers and pharmacists to be overly cautious when it comes to any medication that can impact pregnancy.
She said a pharmacist told her, ""We're now required to make sure that your doctor is prescribing you this medication for what it says it's prescribed for and not for having an abortion."" TELEMEDICINE: Demand for telemedicine abortions increases but could face legal challenges post-Roe Noblin was furious.
Wade, abortion bans from the 1800s became legal matters in these states ""And I said, 'Well, that won't be a problem with my insurance because I'm already on a very serious treatment for an autoimmune issue,"" she recalled, noting to the doctor that the medication could cause birth defects.
""When any patient brings a concern forward, we investigate in a timely manner."" DeAngelis of CVS said that it was not the company's policy to deny medications outright in the ways Rule, Noblin and Thompson described.
MEDICARE PART D: Where you live can have a big impact on what you pay for drugs Policies for reproductive choices have precedents In the past, there have been extra policies and procedures in place to get medications that could cause birth defects, women's health advocates said.
""The main one that I'm aware of prior to Roe being overturned is for Accutane, which is an acne medication that can cause severe birth defects,"" said Christie Pitney, provider coordinator for Plan C, an organization dedicated to spreading information about how to access and take abortion pills.","The nation's two largest pharmacies, Walgreens and CVS, have updated their company policies to allow their pharmacists to deny medication to people who they think could be circumventing new abortion laws by causing a miscarriage. In a case called Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, the Supreme Court in June overturned its 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion. The decision shifted the abortion debate to the states, some of which have passed laws â€?or are relying on earlier statutes â€?to ban the procedure. But under policies like the type Walgreens and CVS have in place, and in the months since the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, people with no plans, ability or wish to be pregnant have been denied necessary medications by Walgreens pharmacists worried about breaking legal restrictions on abortion, say women's advocacy groups like Global Healthy Living Foundation, a chronic illness association. What customers should know: Walgreens, CVS pharmacists are withholding medications for people post-Roe.

Mike DeAngelis, executive director for corporate communications at CVS, said the company requires its pharmacists to confirm a medication will not be used to terminate a pregnancy before it will fill a drug. He said that in some locations, CVS had its policy in place prior to Dobbs, like in Texas, where a restrictive law on abortions went into effect prior to the Supreme Court's decision in June. ""Thatâ€™s why we require pharmacists in these states to validate with the provider that the intended indication is not to terminate a pregnancy before they fill a prescription,"" DeAngelis said. ""To help ensure patients have quick and easy access to medications, providers are strongly encouraged to include their diagnosis on the prescriptions they write.""

Walgreens, CVS already have policies denying birth control Both Walgreens and the nation's largest pharmacy, CVS, already have policies in place that allow pharmacists to deny customers birth control if it conflicts with their personal beliefs. Under those guidelines, pharmacists can refuse to sell to customers condoms, birth control pills or other medications like Plan B, an oral emergency contraception medication that can be taken up to five days after unprotected sex to reduce the risk of pregnancy. Those policies led to public and viral boycotts of both businesses earlier this year when frustrated customers took to social media to document their difficulty in filling birth control prescriptions or buying condoms. BOYCOTTS SPREAD: CVS Pharmacy has similar policy to Walgreens, allows pharmacists to deny birth control prescriptions HOW TO GET BIRTH CONTROL: What to do if CVS, the nation's largest pharmacy, refuses to fill your birth control People denied medication in case they might become pregnant The fallout from the Supreme Court's decision has created vast uncertainty among medical providers in some states as legislatures pass more restrictive abortion laws. Details about what's permitted and how those restrictions will be enforced are sometimes unclear. A local TV station in Tucson, Arizona, reported that a 14-year-old girl was denied a refill of a rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug she had been taking for years just two days after Arizonaâ€™s new abortion law took effect. The drug, called methotrexate, can treat RA but is also used to end ectopic pregnancies, a potentially fatal condition where the fertilized egg lodges outside the uterus. And a New York woman's TikToks about being denied medication for painful cluster headaches because the drug could cause birth defects got more than 3 million views and tens of thousands of comments. Concerns and stories of other medication denials have been reported to advocates from people with chronic conditions who fear not being able to get treatment simply because they have the ability to get pregnant. Doctors and health advocates say the vagueness of many of the state laws banning abortion is leading prescribers and pharmacists to be overly cautious when it comes to any medication that can impact pregnancy. ABORTION UPDATE: Restrictive abortion laws in Arizona, Ohio put on hold; providers resume procedures RULING'S RAPID IMPACT: 66 clinics have stopped doing procedure in these 15 states After the overturning of Roe, ""we started getting emails, tweets, calls from patients saying, number one, 'I'm hearing about this, is this going to happen to me? I'm really, really concerned,'"" said Zoe Rothblatt, associate director of community outreach for Global Healthy Living Foundation. She said the second most-common thing the organization heard was patients having to give extra verification for their diagnosis. ""So they would show up to their pharmacy and the pharmacist would say, we can't prescribe this, we can't dispense this drug to you because it can be used for an abortion."" The American College of Rheumatology issued a statement to policymakers about the need to preserve access to methotrexate, noting that the dosage for ending an ectopic pregnancy is much higher than what is prescribed for inflammatory diseases. Tara Rule, 31, has Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, an inherited disorder that affects connective tissues including skin and joints. Rule is on disability because of her medical conditions and has decided to never have children. She said she has been prescribed medications that can impact pregnancy in the past, which is why she was shocked to be denied a drug that could help her, and tearfully took to TikTok to share her experience in September. ""I've been sick my whole life,"" she says in one video and goes on to describe being denied an treatment for painful cluster headaches by a doctor at an upstate New York hospital. ""Because I'm of childbearing age, I can't get it."" Annie Noblin of West Plains, Missouri, was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in January and prescribed methotrexate. The 40-year-old mother of one told USA TODAY that she didn't have any trouble getting her refills until after the Dobbs decision. She said a pharmacist told her, ""We're now required to make sure that your doctor is prescribing you this medication for what it says it's prescribed for and not for having an abortion."" TELEMEDICINE: Demand for telemedicine abortions increases but could face legal challenges post-Roe Noblin was furious. She's not planning to have more kids, she said, but that's none of the pharmacist's business. After getting verification from her doctor that the drug was for arthritis, the prescription was filled. But she said the next month when she went back, the computer prompted a pharmacy employee to ask her if she was pregnant. ""I feel like I should be trusted,"" she said. Teens are also being denied medication Emma Thompson is the 14-year-old who was denied methotrexate for debilitating rheumatoid arthritis and osteoporosis, according to KOLD News 13. The station reported she was also able to get her medication 24 hours after being denied. But her mother and doctor said they were angry that she had to jump through hoops to get a medication she'd been on for years. Welcome to AZ. Today a pharmacist denied the MTX refill for my adolescent patient. She's on 5 mg/wk to prevent AHCA Ab production. MTX denied purely because she's a female, barely a teenager. Livid! No discussion, just a denial. Now to fight for what's best for this pt. â€?Deborah Jane Power (@bonespower) September 27, 2022 But pharmacies have been leery of providing medications that could run afoul of local laws. ""In certain cases, pharmacists may face criminal charges for dispensing medications for this purpose,"" DeAngelis of CVS told USA TODAY. Patients have also been forced to answer questions about their sex lives Rule, the woman with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, said she went to see a new neurologist specifically because she started having cluster headaches again after about five years and wanted to know if there were any new treatments available. She said the doctor told her a number of new medications could treat her condition. But he warned that her insurance might not cover them because they can cause birth defects. LEGAL BATTLES: After Roe v. Wade, abortion bans from the 1800s became legal matters in these states ""And I said, 'Well, that won't be a problem with my insurance because I'm already on a very serious treatment for an autoimmune issue,"" she recalled, noting to the doctor that the medication could cause birth defects. After learning that, the doctor started asking about her sex life. ""It was strange to be asked such detailed questions regarding my reproductive system, my sex life, from a neurologist,"" Rule said. She explained that she did not plan to have children because of her health, but the doctor refused to tell the names of the medications. After her initial video, Rule posted one saying that she'd been denied treatment at another hospital in the Albany Med Health System and threatened with legal action because she'd posted a recording of her earlier visit. In response to questions about her claims from USA TODAY, Matt Markham, Albany Med's vice president of communications and marketing, sent a statement. ""Our mission is to care for any patient who needs us. We encourage all patients to be actively engaged in their care,"" it reads. ""When any patient brings a concern forward, we investigate in a timely manner."" DeAngelis of CVS said that it was not the company's policy to deny medications outright in the ways Rule, Noblin and Thompson described. ""If a patient has indicated this occurred at a CVS Pharmacy, we would look into it immediately,"" he said. MEDICARE PART D: Where you live can have a big impact on what you pay for drugs Policies for reproductive choices have precedents In the past, there have been extra policies and procedures in place to get medications that could cause birth defects, women's health advocates said. But they didn't typically hear about pharmacies outright denying medication until recently, they told USA TODAY. ""The main one that I'm aware of prior to Roe being overturned is for Accutane, which is an acne medication that can cause severe birth defects,"" said Christie Pitney, provider coordinator for Plan C, an organization dedicated to spreading information about how to access and take abortion pills. ""(People) often have to document that they're using a reliable birth control method,"" she said. There are numerous medications that can cause birth defects that have been prescribed to women of childbearing age in the past, according to March of Dimes. They include: * Opioids * Certain ACE inhibitors used to treat high blood pressure, some depression and seizure medications * Isotretinoin, which was formerly sold as Accutane, to treat acne * Thalomid, which is used to treat certain skin conditions, cancers and complications from HIV * Blood clot prevention medicine Warfarin Rule has now started a Change.org petition to end a doctors' ability to deny treatment for â€œchildbearing ageâ€?patients. ""Legislation needs to be put in place to reprimand any physician or insurance company that chooses to prioritize a hypothetical life that does not exist over the well-being of a suffering human being who actually EXISTS,"" the petition says. CVS spokesman DeAngelis said the issue is fraught for pharmacists as well. ""Our pharmacists are caught in the middle on this issue; while our highest priority is ensuring safe and timely access to medications, we must also ensure our pharmacists are abiding by applicable laws and protect them from potential penalties,"" he said.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,2019/12/4,"impacts on communities, impacts on landscapes, local pollution, airborne pollutants, health impact","Chevron, Facing Fossil Fuels Glut, Takes $10 Billion Charge; Oil giant cuts holdings, including shale, citing prices caused oversupply
In the largest write-down by an energy producer in years, Chevron said Tuesday that it was cutting the value of a number of properties, notably its U.S. shale holdings in Appalachia, by a combined $10 billion to $11 billion.
Chevron is also restructuring its operations to focus on fewer prospects in the face of persistently low natural gas prices, and will explore sales of some assets.
The second-largest U.S. oil company lowered its forecast for future commodity prices, and said that as a result, it was reducing the value of production from one of its offshore oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico, called Big Foot.
Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview that the company had performed well in a difficult market but wanted to focus on its most promising future prospects, including an expansion of shale oil drilling in Texas.
The sobering reappraisal by Chevron, one of the world's largest and best-performing oil companies, is likely to ripple through the oil-and-gas industry, forcing others to publicly reassess the value of their holdings in the face of a global supply glut and growing investor concerns about the long-term future of fossil fuels.
Industry executives and analysts anticipate that many more oil-and-gas companies will soon write down billions in value to comply with accounting standards because low commodity prices have undermined the economics of many projects.
has written down the value of its U.S. natural gas assets by about $2.5 billion over the last several years, though some analysts have said it should further devalue its largest shale asset, XTO Energy Inc., which it bought for more than $30 billion in 2010.
An abundance of discoveries over the last decade, particularly the flood of oil and gas unlocked by the U.S. shale boom, has led to consistently low commodity prices and eaten into fossil fuel companies' profits.
Mr. Wirth said that while some natural gas projects have become uneconomic, the fuel remains an important part of Chevron's strategy.
""The world runs on oil and gas today and any energy transition will take time,"" Mr. Wirth said.","Chevron Corp. is writing down the value of its assets by more than $10 billion, a concession that in an age of abundant oil and gas some of its holdings won't be profitable anytime soon. In the largest write-down by an energy producer in years, Chevron said Tuesday that it was cutting the value of a number of properties, notably its U.S. shale holdings in Appalachia, by a combined $10 billion to $11 billion. Chevron is also restructuring its operations to focus on fewer prospects in the face of persistently low natural gas prices, and will explore sales of some assets. The second-largest U.S. oil company lowered its forecast for future commodity prices, and said that as a result, it was reducing the value of production from one of its offshore oil projects in the Gulf of Mexico, called Big Foot. It also lowered the value of a planned facility to export liquefied natural gas from Canada. Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said in an interview that the company had performed well in a difficult market but wanted to focus on its most promising future prospects, including an expansion of shale oil drilling in Texas. ""We have to make the tough choices to high-grade our portfolio and invest in the highest-return projects in the world we see ahead of us, and that's a different world than the one that lies behind us,"" Mr. Wirth said. Chevron's shares closed up less than a percentage point at $117.90 prior to the announcement Tuesday. Reaction to the news was muted in after-hours trading. The sobering reappraisal by Chevron, one of the world's largest and best-performing oil companies, is likely to ripple through the oil-and-gas industry, forcing others to publicly reassess the value of their holdings in the face of a global supply glut and growing investor concerns about the long-term future of fossil fuels. Particular pressure is falling on shale producers, especially those focused on natural gas in places like Pennsylvania, which are struggling with historically low U.S. prices caused by oversupply. Chevron's move follows a $5 billion write-down by Spain's Repsol SA earlier this month and an impairment of $2.6 billion by the U.K.'s BP PLC in October. Industry executives and analysts anticipate that many more oil-and-gas companies will soon write down billions in value to comply with accounting standards because low commodity prices have undermined the economics of many projects. Many companies are also expected to substantially reduce the value of their oil and gas reserves, figures once seen as essential measures of their long-term security, under separate reporting requirements governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission amid uncertainty over whether the fossil fuels can be cost-effectively extracted. Chevron may restate its reserves to the SEC after any asset sales, a company executive said. ""As the data gets more compelling, they have to face it,"" said Myron Boots, co-founder of reservoir engineering consulting firm Buckley & Boots LLC, noting that many wells have failed to live up to expectations. Exxon Mobil Corp. has written down the value of its U.S. natural gas assets by about $2.5 billion over the last several years, though some analysts have said it should further devalue its largest shale asset, XTO Energy Inc., which it bought for more than $30 billion in 2010. An Exxon spokesman declined to comment on Chevron's decision Tuesday, noting that it is difficult to compare write-offs across different companies. Only 20 years ago, the oil-and-gas industry was worried about running out of fossil fuels and scoured the world for reserves. Today, it faces a different problem: too much oil and gas. An abundance of discoveries over the last decade, particularly the flood of oil and gas unlocked by the U.S. shale boom, has led to consistently low commodity prices and eaten into fossil fuel companies' profits. The techniques behind the boom, horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have upended global markets, Mr. Wirth said. ""They have truly transformed the market mind-set from one of scarcity to one of abundance,"" he said. ""It's the story of our industry."" Russia and OPEC have been curtailing oil production for years to put a floor under global prices and agreed last week to further cuts of 500,000 barrels a day until the end of March. Still, oil companies have struggled to reap the profits of old and are falling out of favor with investors amid fears that electric vehicles and renewable energy, along with government regulations to address a warming planet, will constrain their futures. Oil-and-gas companies now make up about 4% of the S&P 500 index, down from roughly 10% a decade ago, FactSet data show. Amid the changing landscape, Chevron has pulled back on its global footprint. It now operates in around 18 countries, according to the company, down from nearly 40 earlier this decade. Mr. Wirth said Chevron must be selective about its investments moving forward, focusing on oil-rich regions like the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico. The company is also undertaking a restructuring, going from four global production units to three. ""Companies that wait until change is forced upon them fail,"" Mr. Wirth said in a video sent to employees last week. ""We're not going to let that happen at Chevron."" Some of the layoffs are likely to come from the company's unit in Appalachia. The company is exploring a sale or strategic alternatives for those assets and the Kitimat LNG project in Canada, one of the projects included in the write-down. Chevron made a big bet on natural gas in 2010, when it acquired Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion and assumed $1.1 billion of the Appalachian producer's debt. At the time, gas prices had tumbled 21% to about $4.21 per million British thermal units. Chevron upped its wager in 2011 with more acquisitions in the region through private transactions that analysts valued at about $1.6 billion at the time. Those bets look misguided today. On Tuesday afternoon, prior to Chevron's announcement, natural gas prices were roughly $2.26 per MMBtu, up about 1.4% on the day. Over the past decade, frackers helped release a gusher of gas that has driven down costs for consumers. But the amount of natural gas produced in the U.S. has exceeded U.S. consumption since 2017, Energy Information Administration data show. Gas prices are expected to continue falling, to an average of about $2 per MMBtu, next year, according to analytics firm IHS Markit. The result has been prolonged hardship for U.S. gas drillers and their investors. That is expected to last well into the next decade, particularly for companies focused on the Appalachian region, which contains much gas but little oil. Chevron is one of the largest leaseholders in Appalachia but only the 18th largest producer there, according to energy consulting firm Rystad Energy, and has fared better than many of its competitors. Mr. Wirth said that while some natural gas projects have become uneconomic, the fuel remains an important part of Chevron's strategy. ""The world runs on oil and gas today and any energy transition will take time,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""Our commitment is to be a responsible provider of that oil and gas.""

The biggest debate about the company is whether it can sell enough assets to pay down its debt: ""The idea that Occidental managementâ€”and specifically the board cannot extract $10 billion â€?$15 billion of asset sales, over the next three years is now the only call against Occidental's investment case,"" Leggate wrote.
Beyond his confidence in the company's balance sheet, Leggate thinks Occidental has one of the premier asset bases in the U.S. For investors who think oil can rise from here, Occidental's holdings are ""one of the most levered to the current futures curve and any further upside to the commodity."" His price target is $32.
On the other hand, Leggate is now less confident in future stock gains for Chevron and Concho.","Occidental Petroleum stock has more than doubled after bottoming at $9 in March, but one analyst thinks it still has more room to run. Bank of America Securities analyst Doug Leggate upgraded Occidental (ticker: OXY) to Buy on Tuesday and downgraded Chevron (CVX) and Concho Resources (CXO) to Neutral ""after a strong recovery off March lows."" Occidental took on a large amount of debt last year to buy Anadarko Petroleum, a Texas producer with substantial acreage in the Permian Basin. Occidental was looking to gain scale in shale drilling. But the purchase came at a bad time. Oil prices have been spiraling lower over the past year. In March, Moody's downgraded Occidental's debt rating to junk. The company has cut its dividend twice. But Leggate thinks that Occidental is now in strong shape to meet its debt obligations and should emerge in a year or two as a stronger company with prospects for increased cash flow. The biggest debate about the company is whether it can sell enough assets to pay down its debt: ""The idea that Occidental managementâ€”and specifically the board cannot extract $10 billion â€?$15 billion of asset sales, over the next three years is now the only call against Occidental's investment case,"" Leggate wrote. The fact that activist investor Carl Icahn and former Occidental CEO Steve Chazen--""a steady hand through multiple oil crises""--are on the board make it more likely that Occidental will get the necessary deals done, Leggate says. And it doesn't hurt that Warren Buffett has a big stake in the company's future, because Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) owns $10 billion worth of preferred stock. Adding the expected asset sales to the company's existing cash, expected cash flow, and its revolving credit line, Leggate comes up with $20 billion in cash through the end of 2022â€”versus $12 billion in debt maturities. ""Our point? We do not believe Occidental has liquidity risk; at a minimum the rebound at the front of the oil curve has materially improved free cash flowâ€”but with the mostly likely risk that management may incur higher cost debt, which may no longer be the case,"" he wrote. Beyond his confidence in the company's balance sheet, Leggate thinks Occidental has one of the premier asset bases in the U.S. For investors who think oil can rise from here, Occidental's holdings are ""one of the most levered to the current futures curve and any further upside to the commodity."" His price target is $32. Occidental was down 4.8% on Tuesday, to $23.24. On the other hand, Leggate is now less confident in future stock gains for Chevron and Concho. For Chevron, he has been impressed by the company's transparency. But that means investors know what they are getting and there are likely to be few surprises ahead. The stock price bakes much of Chevron's strengths in already. ""Thus while we saw Chevron as one of the expressions of an oversold energy sector at the peak of the market stress, the rebound has similarly moved the shares back to levels we see as fairly valued, albeit still a low risk play on a long-term oil recovery,"" he wrote. His price target is $110. Chevron was down 0.9% on Tuesday to $102.33. Concho similarly has less upside ahead. ""Concho has done everything right; but from here we believe shares are fairly valued and accordingly, we lower our rating to Neutral,"" he wrote. His price target is $76. Concho was down 10% on Tuesday, to $65.08.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,2020/7/16,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, greenhouse gas emissions","Border Town Rise. Pandemic Hit.
â€œThey said to him, what if the border closes down?â€?Mr. Saunders recalled.
When the border between the United States and Canada closed to nonessential travel on March 21, the southbound traffic into Blaine â€?the busiest crossing between Washington and British Columbia â€?slowed to a trickle.
â€œThe longer this goes, the more devastating it gets,â€?Michael Ebert, the president of Blaineâ€™s Chamber of Commerce, said as he pointed to the empty storefronts and recently shuttered shops.
Other businesses followed â€?including the Starbucks next to Mr. Hillâ€™s gas station, which opened in 2018, and a hemp clothing store called Rawganique.
â€œWe all felt like Blaine was finally going to hit its time,â€?said Mark Seymour, who works with his father, Steve Seymour, at their oyster farm and restaurant.
â€œAnd then this happened.â€?â€œGas and packages have been the backbone of our economy,â€?Mr. Ebert, the Chamber of Commerce president, said.
â€œAll this is kind of a war zone,â€?Mr. Baron said, gesturing to piles of â€œforwardsâ€?in the lobby â€?boxes that his staff needed to measure to calculate what it would cost to ship them to Canada.
â€œThey tell me theyâ€™re bored,â€?said Mr. Saunders, who recognized a couple of the officers by name.
For a while, some even set up tents in the park, Mr. Saunders said, until those got shut down recently, too.
â€œIâ€™m not very optimistic at all,â€?Steve Seymour said during a recent interview at the family business, Drayton Harbor Oysters.
â€œWhy would they let us in?â€?Drayton is just a couple of minutes down the street from Mr. Hillâ€™s Chevron and Starbucks, and business is down, Mr. Seymour said.
â€œMy whole vision now is just to get through this year without being totally in huge debt,â€?Mr. Seymour said.","How the closure of the U.S.-Canada border in March devastated the economy of a Washington town. BLAINE, Wash. â€?Over the past couple of years, Mike Hill poured more than $3.5 million into renovating his Chevron gas station and opening a Starbucks next door. People from British Columbia were crossing the border in droves to buy cheap gas and milk in Blaine, Wash. It seemed like a slam dunk investment. Len Saunders, an American immigration attorney, remembers talking to Mr. Hill about the plan when he was trying to convince Starbucks to open in town. â€œThey said to him, what if the border closes down?â€?Mr. Saunders recalled. The idea seemed so preposterous to those who lived in Blaine that â€œeveryone laughed.â€?Then the coronavirus arrived. Now almost no one comes to Blaine anymore. When the border between the United States and Canada closed to nonessential travel on March 21, the southbound traffic into Blaine â€?the busiest crossing between Washington and British Columbia â€?slowed to a trickle. In June, just 12,600 people entered the United States from British Columbia, down from 479,600 during the same month last year. The economic impact on Blaine, a city of about 5,000, has been crippling. Beaches are now largely empty save for the rocks left by the receding tide. More than a dozen gas stations that once bustled with people heading elsewhere are quiet. The stores that handled mail-order goods for Canadians looking to avoid taxes are piled high with packages that their purchasers cannot pick up. â€œThe longer this goes, the more devastating it gets,â€?Michael Ebert, the president of Blaineâ€™s Chamber of Commerce, said as he pointed to the empty storefronts and recently shuttered shops. The loss is particularly painful to Mr. Hill, 59, a lifelong resident who has seen the town go through cycles â€?he used to help kick the drunks out of his familyâ€™s bar, back when Canada banned alcohol on Sundays and a rowdier crowd frequented Blaineâ€™s night spots. Mr. Hill acknowledges that Blaine was always a way station for people heading to perhaps more interesting locales. And sure, there were some empty storefronts on Main Street before the pandemic closed many of them down. But in the last few years, he saw more businesses coming into town. In large part, the resurgence was fueled by Amazon. Canadians could save money on shipping and taxes by sending their orders to stores in the United States and picking them up later. Today, Blaine has dozens of businesses handling packages from online commerce. Other businesses followed â€?including the Starbucks next to Mr. Hillâ€™s gas station, which opened in 2018, and a hemp clothing store called Rawganique. A grocery store was set to move in soon. â€œWe all felt like Blaine was finally going to hit its time,â€?said Mark Seymour, who works with his father, Steve Seymour, at their oyster farm and restaurant. â€œAnd then this happened.â€?â€œGas and packages have been the backbone of our economy,â€?Mr. Ebert, the Chamber of Commerce president, said. â€œYou come around the holidays, these package places, by the time theyâ€™re open, theyâ€™ve got about 20, 25 in line.â€?At Mail Boxes International, employees say that it feels like Christmas â€?only without the joy. Yet-to-be-claimed boxes are piled waist-high in the lobby. The top shelves of the storeroom, normally bare, are stacked tall enough to reach the rafters. When the border first closed, many Canadians figured it would reopen soon, and they kept ordering online goods, the owner, Brant Baron, said. He put a second storage container in the parking lot to handle the overflow. But then the border reopening got pushed back again, and then again, and Canadians stopped ordering as much. Looking at all the boxes, you would not know that business is down 75 percent. â€œAll this is kind of a war zone,â€?Mr. Baron said, gesturing to piles of â€œforwardsâ€?in the lobby â€?boxes that his staff needed to measure to calculate what it would cost to ship them to Canada. Most customers, Mr. Baron predicted, would find it prohibitively expensive, and he would have to find a place for them in the storage room. â€œWeâ€™ve gotten creative with the shelving,â€?he said. Just months ago, cars may have crawled through several lanes of traffic for hours before crossing the border. Now, all of those lanes are empty. On a recent afternoon, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle sat in the highway leading into Canada, and several officers milled around. â€œThey tell me theyâ€™re bored,â€?said Mr. Saunders, who recognized a couple of the officers by name. Normally they would be stationed inside the port of entry inspecting applicants for admission, he said. Sometimes they patrolled Peace Arch Park, a strip of land straddling the border where people from both countries can still meet. The park also serves as Mr. Saundersâ€™s de facto office since he tries to avoid meeting clients inside his office these days. Early in the pandemic, he worried that his business would dry up. But many people, especially couples separated by the border closure, have been rushing to get their green cards processed. For a while, some even set up tents in the park, Mr. Saunders said, until those got shut down recently, too. â€œWhy do you think theyâ€™re in tents?â€?he said. â€œThey havenâ€™t seen each other in three months.â€?On Tuesday, officials confirmed that the border would remain closed until at least Aug. 21, extending the reopening for a fifth time. Canada has had about half as many coronavirus deaths per capita as the United States. The number of cases in Canada has been steadily declining since April, while cases in some states are surging. â€œIâ€™m not very optimistic at all,â€?Steve Seymour said during a recent interview at the family business, Drayton Harbor Oysters. â€œWhy would they let us in?â€?Drayton is just a couple of minutes down the street from Mr. Hillâ€™s Chevron and Starbucks, and business is down, Mr. Seymour said. Still, he considers himself one of the lucky ones. The city gave him permission to use a little more outdoor space for extra tables, he said, and on a recent afternoon, customers were ordering grilled garlic butter oysters and fried shrimp tacos to eat at tables they were asked to bus themselves. Mr. Seymour farms his oysters nearby, and Drayton had been attracting Washingtonians who liked the farm-to-table approach. Mr. Seymour is thinking about what is next. He can still do takeout when the winter comes. And although he just spent money on new tables and chairs, he is considering buying tents and heaters for outdoor dining in the cold. â€œMy whole vision now is just to get through this year without being totally in huge debt,â€?Mr. Seymour said. Blaine had been on an upswing, after all. Business, he was sure, would be back.

Chevron has pledged to limit the pace of growth of its carbon emissions that contribute to climate change, but has not set longer-term targets to achieve net zero as many European oil companies have done. Shareholder proposals include reducing so-called Scope 3 emissions that come from the use of its fuels and a request that the company report the impact of net zero 2050 scenarios on its finances and business assumptions, according to the company's proxy filing on Thursday. Chevron has set emissions targets for this decade and laid out plans to keep project spending low but increase oil and gas output. The company is recommending that its stock holders vote against the shareholder proposals, including one for an independent board chair after the next chief executive transition. Other proposals asks for more lobbying disclosures and to shift to being a ""public benefit corporation,"" a legal structure in which directors must balance the interests of shareholders and other stakeholders. Shareholders last May voted to approve a proposal demanding that the company issue a report on its climate change-related lobbying activities, a major win for activists against big oil. Chevron issued a climate lobbying report in December. The filing included details on executive compensation, including $29 million for CEO Michael Wirth in 2020, down from $33.1 million in 2019. The company had a $5.54 billion full-year loss for 2020, its first since 2016, compared with earnings of $2.92 billion in 2019.

Chevron Corporation,CVX,2021/4/20,"impacts on communities, local pollution, waste issues","Litigation End: Chevron Battles 28-Year-old Ecuador Lawsuit; Facing huge damage award U.S. courts deem fraudulent, oil company pollution verdict voided country
A decade earlier, an Ecuadorean court had blamed Chevron for oil pollution and told it to pay $9.5 billion in damages, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind.
Twenty-eight years after the Ecuador case was filed, 10 years after it came to a verdict and seven years after Chevron got a different court to find egregious misbehavior by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Chevron fights onâ€”pressing to make sure that lawyer doesn't profit from the case, hiring attorneys in countries where it operates and where plaintiffs might try to collect, trying to force Ecuador to pay its legal costs and, as with the roses, asking the U.S. government to penalize Ecuador in the trade arena.
The company scored a seminal victory in 2014 when a federal judge in New York found that Mr. Donziger and others on his team had offered a bribe to a judge in Ecuador and had ghost-written the court verdict.
""What is happening to me is a sign of our success,"" he said, using a bullhorn: ""This is a corporate playbook that is designed really by Chevron and the entire fossil-fuel industry to silence advocacy."" Below his window hung a sign saying ""SOS Free Steven!"" The company's strategy ""is to pulverize me personally, to criminalize me,"" Mr. Donziger said in an interview.
""This idea they've won and I've lost is their view, not my view."" Chevron is asking the tribunal that ordered Ecuador to void the verdictâ€”a panel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hagueâ€”to also order nearly $800 million of Chevron's legal costs to be paid by Ecuador, a country whose gross domestic product is about half of Chevron's stock-market value.
As the years go on, he said, ""it's not being done for reasons that look rational."" Chevron's Mr. Pate said the company has no choice but to continue defending itself because the ""perpetrators of the fraud"" refuse to acknowledge court and arbitration findings.
Chevron's defense and Mr. Donziger's personal case have overshadowed the original plaintiffs, natives of the forested northeast of Ecuador, who say their drinking water and quality of life remain damaged by oil drilling.
Mr. Donziger, a former public defender fluent in Spanish, joined the plaintiffs' team early on and became the face of the case in Ecuador, with a strategy that relied heavily on swaying public opinion.
Chevron secured the outtakes of a documentary film on the case and turned up clips such as one where Mr. Donziger recounted a favorite quote to colleagues: ""Facts do not exist.
Facts are created."" It also amassed evidence that Mr. Donziger and his team had pressured Ecuadorean judges to rule in their favor and secretly wrote the bulk of the report of a court-appointed outside expert who said Chevron should pay $27.3 billion.
Mr. Donziger said the plaintiffs' activities followed Ecuadorean court customs.
Chevron then civilly sued Mr. Donziger and his team under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law often used against mobsters.
Two weeks later, a judge in Ecuador handed down the verdict against Chevron, then doubled the damages to $19 billion after Chevron refused an order to apologize.
With Chevron refusing to pay, and having no assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs tried unsuccessfully to collect in places where the oil company operated, such as Argentina, Brazil and Canada.
Its strategy was vindicated in March 2014 when, after a civil trial in New York, a federal judge issued a 485-page opinion concluding that Mr. Donziger and his team had submitted false evidence in Ecuador, paid off a court-appointed expert and ghost-written much of his opinion, and promised $500,000 to an Ecuadorean judge to rule in their favor.
Chevron lawyers filed motions every time they thought Mr. Donziger might be violating the judge's orders.
said Mr. Donziger told him the plaintiffs had raised $33 million, and 15% to 20% of the damage award was committed to investors and others.
Chevron also told the court Mr. Donziger had hired an executive coach and agreed to pay him 0.007% of whatever was collected from Chevron, out of Mr. Donziger's share.
Two months later, Judge Kaplan ordered a trial to determine whether Mr. Donziger should be held in criminal contempt of court for continuing to ignore the orders.
New York state's appellate court said the official was too dismissive of the severity of the misconduct, and it disbarred Mr. Donziger last August.
Though Ecuador hasn't done this, Chevron officials point to instances where, they say, its representatives have admitted the verdict was fraudulent.
In one, Ecuador's ambassador told the U.S. Trade Representative in a letter last July that Ecuador had been in touch with authorities in countries where plaintiffs sought to enforce what she called ""the fraudulent Lago Agrio judgment."" Share Your Thoughts What's right and what's wrong in the long-running litigation against Chevron in Ecuador?","Chevron Corp. was fixated on roses. The giant U.S. oil company objected last June when Washington proposed allowing duty-free rose imports from the world's poorest countries, including Ecuador. A decade earlier, an Ecuadorean court had blamed Chevron for oil pollution and told it to pay $9.5 billion in damages, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind. Chevron had since proved the verdict fraudulent, it told the U.S. Trade Representative. But Ecuador refused to render it unenforceable despite an order to do that from an international arbitration tribunal. Letting Ecuador save money on flowers after blatant ""acts of defiance"" would tell the world the U.S. rewards bad behavior, the oil company said. Chevron lost the war of the roses. But it still hasn't paid a cent of the Ecuadorean judgment, and says it won't stop legally battling until it can ensure that it never has to. ""We're going to fight this until hell freezes over, and then we'll fight it on the ice,"" a former Chevron general counsel, Charles James, said before his retirement in 2010, a remark that became a watchword at the company. His successor, R. Hewitt Pate, said this spring that ""only the government of Ecuador could deliver a final resolution of this case,"" by nullifying the verdict. Big companies that see lawsuits against them as unfounded often reach a point, after losing a court ruling or two, when settling seems the sensible course. Chevron never did. Twenty-eight years after the Ecuador case was filed, 10 years after it came to a verdict and seven years after Chevron got a different court to find egregious misbehavior by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Chevron fights onâ€”pressing to make sure that lawyer doesn't profit from the case, hiring attorneys in countries where it operates and where plaintiffs might try to collect, trying to force Ecuador to pay its legal costs and, as with the roses, asking the U.S. government to penalize Ecuador in the trade arena. Chevron's opponents also refuse to back down, making the case what appears to be the oil industry's longest-running legal slugfest. Aspects of it have been heard by some 100 judges in 36 courts in seven countries. By Chevron's estimate, it has cost the company nearly $1 billion, including 1.5 million hours of its staff, advisers' and attorneys' time. Executives and lawyers who worked on the case have retired or died since it began. Although the oil industry's era of global power seems to have peaked, for Chevron part of that eraâ€”costly, intractable environmental-pollution litigationâ€”continues unabated. The Ecuador legal fight has lasted even longer than the one that followed the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. Well before Chevron lost the damage verdict in 2011, it set out to turn the tables on the litigants. It subpoenaed or sued dozens of people who had helped the plaintiffs' side, legal records show, and unearthed damaging video clips about the plaintiffs' legal team's activities from documentary-film outtakes. Chevron's lawyers obtained the personal notes of the lead plaintiffs' lawyer, Steven Donziger, and used his own words against him. The company scored a seminal victory in 2014 when a federal judge in New York found that Mr. Donziger and others on his team had offered a bribe to a judge in Ecuador and had ghost-written the court verdict. Mr. Donziger's New York law license was revoked. He faces a criminal contempt-of-court trial this month over his refusal to turn over records to Chevron as ordered. His bank accounts were frozen. He has been under house arrest for nearly two years, unable to leave his Manhattan apartment without court permission, an ankle bracelet tracking his every move. In December, Mr. Donziger shouted out his window to supporters gathered below to mark his 500th day of detention. ""What is happening to me is a sign of our success,"" he said, using a bullhorn: ""This is a corporate playbook that is designed really by Chevron and the entire fossil-fuel industry to silence advocacy."" Below his window hung a sign saying ""SOS Free Steven!"" The company's strategy ""is to pulverize me personally, to criminalize me,"" Mr. Donziger said in an interview. ""This idea they've won and I've lost is their view, not my view."" Chevron is asking the tribunal that ordered Ecuador to void the verdictâ€”a panel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hagueâ€”to also order nearly $800 million of Chevron's legal costs to be paid by Ecuador, a country whose gross domestic product is about half of Chevron's stock-market value. ÃÃ±igo Salvador Crespo, an Ecuador justice official whose agency represents the country in the dispute, declined to comment, saying to do so could compromise its legal strategy. A newly elected president of Ecuador who hasn't yet taken office, Guillermo Lasso, didn't respond to requests for comment on the dispute. Chevron officials say they have punched back so hard, for so long, because they found fraud in the litigation and because Ecuador in the 1990s granted a release from liability after a cleanup. ""This was never for Chevron one of these things where we added up potential liability and said we have to fight this because the number is too much,"" Mr. James, the former general counsel, said in an interview. To some longtime observers of the case, it looks more like a grudge match with Mr. Donziger, who has refused to concede anything despite a series of court losses. ""They're making an example of him,"" said Ted Folkman, an attorney who has closely followed the legal battle. As the years go on, he said, ""it's not being done for reasons that look rational."" Chevron's Mr. Pate said the company has no choice but to continue defending itself because the ""perpetrators of the fraud"" refuse to acknowledge court and arbitration findings. Chevron's defense and Mr. Donziger's personal case have overshadowed the original plaintiffs, natives of the forested northeast of Ecuador, who say their drinking water and quality of life remain damaged by oil drilling. ""Chevron wants to talk about the injustices they have suffered. Steven wants to talk about the injustice he is suffering. Who is talking about the people on the ground and how they've been affected?"" said Judith Kimerling, a professor of environmental law and policy at the City University of New York's Queens College, whose research in Ecuador inspired the original lawsuit. Chevron inherited the already eight-year-old dispute in 2001 when it acquired Texaco Inc., which operated in Ecuador from the 1960s to 1990 in partnership with government-run Petroecuador. They drilled in an area of the Amazon occupied only by native people and migrant farmers, and gave it the name Lago Agrio. Texaco spent $40 million on local cleanup and obtained a liability release from Ecuador's government in the 1990s. Chevron says that means any remaining pollution is the responsibility of its state-owned former partner. A group of Amazonians sued Texaco in 1993 in federal court in New York, saying they were sickened by water and air polluted from the oil operations. Texaco said the suit belonged in Ecuador, a judge agreed, and a new suit was filed there in 2003. This suit took advantage of a newly passed Ecuadorean law that allowed individuals to sue not only for harm to themselves but also for damage to the environment. Mr. Donziger, a former public defender fluent in Spanish, joined the plaintiffs' team early on and became the face of the case in Ecuador, with a strategy that relied heavily on swaying public opinion. He rallied activists in front of the Lago Agrio courthouse. A documentary film crew followed him as he barged into judges' offices to make demands. The plaintiffs' side brought journalists to villages where residents lived alongside drilling waste in unlined pits. Chevron put on counter-tours to sites reflecting Texaco's cleanup. Around 2009, Chevron adopted a strategy of trying to show that plaintiffs' lawyers were acting improperly. It hired Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, a law firm that had helped Dole Food Co. defeat litigation by Nicaraguan banana farmers who claimed to be left sterile by Dole pesticides; Gibson Dunn convinced a U.S. judge lawyers had recruited plaintiffs who weren't sterile or didn't even work on a Dole banana property. For Chevron, a Gibson Dunn team led by Randy Mastro, once a top aide to Rudy Giuliani when he was New York City mayor, probed every aspect of the plaintiffs' case. Using an obscure court process called Section 1782, which allows parties to seek evidence in the U.S. to help with foreign lawsuits, Gibson Dunn gained access to troves of internal documents from people who had worked with the plaintiffs. Chevron secured the outtakes of a documentary film on the case and turned up clips such as one where Mr. Donziger recounted a favorite quote to colleagues: ""Facts do not exist. Facts are created."" It also amassed evidence that Mr. Donziger and his team had pressured Ecuadorean judges to rule in their favor and secretly wrote the bulk of the report of a court-appointed outside expert who said Chevron should pay $27.3 billion. Mr. Donziger said the plaintiffs' activities followed Ecuadorean court customs. In a conference room in lower Manhattan in 2010, Gibson Dunn pitched federal prosecutors on the idea of criminally prosecuting Mr. Donziger. They declined, figuring this was a squabble between a corporation and well-funded adversaries that wasn't worth their limited resources, said a person familiar with the meeting. Chevron then civilly sued Mr. Donziger and his team under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a federal law often used against mobsters. It filed the RICO suit on Feb. 1, 2011. Two weeks later, a judge in Ecuador handed down the verdict against Chevron, then doubled the damages to $19 billion after Chevron refused an order to apologize. It was later reduced back to $9.5 billion but otherwise upheld by the Ecuadorean courts. With Chevron refusing to pay, and having no assets in Ecuador, the plaintiffs tried unsuccessfully to collect in places where the oil company operated, such as Argentina, Brazil and Canada. Chevron hired lawyers around the world to resist such efforts. Its strategy was vindicated in March 2014 when, after a civil trial in New York, a federal judge issued a 485-page opinion concluding that Mr. Donziger and his team had submitted false evidence in Ecuador, paid off a court-appointed expert and ghost-written much of his opinion, and promised $500,000 to an Ecuadorean judge to rule in their favor. Even if they sought to help native people, Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote, ""they were not entitled to corrupt the process to achieve their goal."" The ruling came with ramifications: Mr. Donziger couldn't try to enforce the Ecuadorean judgment in the U.S. and he couldn't profit from it; he had to relinquish his 6.3% interest in any payout. Mr. Donziger appealed the ruling and lost. ""I believe it is invalid, though I recognize courts have found otherwise,"" he said. Chevron lawyers filed motions every time they thought Mr. Donziger might be violating the judge's orders. An example was when he asked a hedge-fund firm to finance efforts to collect the damages in return for a share of them. A portfolio manager at Elliott Management Corp. said Mr. Donziger told him the plaintiffs had raised $33 million, and 15% to 20% of the damage award was committed to investors and others. Elliott turned him down, the portfolio manager said in a sworn affidavit. A spokesman for Elliott declined to comment. Chevron also told the court Mr. Donziger had hired an executive coach and agreed to pay him 0.007% of whatever was collected from Chevron, out of Mr. Donziger's share. Chevron said that violated the ban on his profiting from the verdict. He argued it didn't, but in May 2019, Judge Kaplan found Mr. Donziger in civil contempt of court. The judge said he violated orders by not turning over all of his electronic devices and email accounts for imaging, for failing to relinquish his stake in the damage award and for his deal with the executive coach. Two months later, Judge Kaplan ordered a trial to determine whether Mr. Donziger should be held in criminal contempt of court for continuing to ignore the orders. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, to which the judge referred the criminal matter, declined to pursue it. In an unusual procedure, Judge Kaplan then appointed a private lawyer to serve as prosecutor and assigned another U.S. district judge, Loretta Preska, to handle the case, which is set for trial starting May 10. It was Judge Preska who put Mr. Donziger under house arrest, deeming him a flight risk. A state appellate court had already suspended Mr. Donziger's law license. He requested a public hearing on that. There, 15 witnesses testified about the honest human-rights lawyer they said they knew, among them Pink Floyd frontman Roger Waters, a co-founder of Greenpeace and an indigenous Ecuadorean leader. Chevron sent a team to observe. A New York judicial official found Mr. Donziger posed no threat to the public and recommended letting him keep his license. Describing him as ""often his own worst enemy,"" the official said: ""The extent of his pursuit by Chevron is so extravagant, and at this point so unnecessary and punitive."" The opinion wasn't binding. New York state's appellate court said the official was too dismissive of the severity of the misconduct, and it disbarred Mr. Donziger last August. He is seeking an appeal of the decision. For years, Chevron separately pursued an international arbitration case. It argued that Ecuador's government had violated an investment treaty with the U.S., both by not upholding the liability release granted in the 1990s and later by allowing a fraudulent court verdict to stand. In 2018 the international arbitration panel sided with Chevron. It ordered Ecuador to wipe out all consequences of the court verdict and preclude anyone from enforcing it, on grounds it was obtained fraudulently. Though Ecuador hasn't done this, Chevron officials point to instances where, they say, its representatives have admitted the verdict was fraudulent. In one, Ecuador's ambassador told the U.S. Trade Representative in a letter last July that Ecuador had been in touch with authorities in countries where plaintiffs sought to enforce what she called ""the fraudulent Lago Agrio judgment."" Share Your Thoughts What's right and what's wrong in the long-running litigation against Chevron in Ecuador? Join the conversation below. The letter from the ambassador, Ivonne Baki, added that Ecuador didn't know what steps it could take to satisfy the arbitration order, saying its laws and international law constrained it from intervening in the court system. Efforts to reach Ms. Baki for comment were unsuccessful. Investors in Chevron appear to have largely ignored the judgment's potential financial impact. But its chief executive, Michael Wirth, continues to face questions about the case. At a virtual shareholders' meeting in May 2020, the actor Alec Baldwin told the CEO Chevron was using shareholders' money to personally attack Mr. Donziger. Mr. Wirth called Mr. Baldwin's summary of the case false and offensive, saying: ""Mr. Donziger is an adjudicated racketeer."" There have been no settlement discussions since 2012. At a meeting that year, held while the damage award was temporarily doubled to $19 billion, Mr. Pate walked out after the plaintiffs' side proposed a nearly $10 billion settlement, according to Mr. Donziger. Chevron didn't dispute that account. Said Dylan Mefford, a California attorney who worked on the case as a Gibson Dunn associate: ""Both sides genuinely felt the others were criminals.""

A decade earlier, an Ecuadorean court had blamed Chevron for oil pollution and told it to pay $9.5 billion in damages, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind.
Twenty-eight years after the Ecuador case was filed, 10 years after it came to a verdict and seven years after Chevron got a different court to find egregious misbehavior by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Chevron fights onâ€”pressing to make sure that lawyer doesn't profit from the case, hiring attorneys in countries where it operates and where plaintiffs might try to collect, trying to force Ecuador to pay its legal costs and, as with the roses, asking the U.S. government to penalize Ecuador in the trade arena.
The company scored a seminal victory in 2014 when a federal judge in New York found that Mr. Donziger and others on his team had offered a bribe to a judge in Ecuador and had ghost-written the court verdict.
""What is happening to me is a sign of our success,"" he said, using a bullhorn: ""This is a corporate playbook that is designed really by Chevron and the entire fossil-fuel industry to silence advocacy."" Below his window hung a sign saying ""SOS Free Steven!"" The company's strategy ""is to pulverize me personally, to criminalize me,"" Mr. Donziger said in an interview.
""This idea they've won and I've lost is their view, not my view."" Chevron is asking the tribunal that ordered Ecuador to void the verdictâ€”a panel of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hagueâ€”to also order nearly $800 million of Chevron's legal costs to be paid by Ecuador, a country whose gross domestic product is about half of Chevron's stock-market value.
As the years go on, he said, ""it's not being done for reasons that look rational."" Chevron's Mr. Pate said the company has no choice but to continue defending itself because the ""perpetrators of the fraud"" refuse to acknowledge court and arbitration findings.
Chevron's defense and Mr. Donziger's personal case have overshadowed the original plaintiffs, natives of the forested northeast of Ecuador, who say their drinking water and quality of life remain damaged by oil drilling.

Share Your Thoughts What's right and what's wrong in the long-running litigation against Chevron in Ecuador?","Chevron Corp. was fixated on roses. The giant U.S. oil company objected last June when Washington proposed allowing duty-free rose imports from the world's poorest countries, including Ecuador. A decade earlier, an Ecuadorean court had blamed Chevron for oil pollution and told it to pay $9.5 billion in damages, one of the largest-ever penalties of its kind. Chevron had since proved the verdict fraudulent, it told the U.S. Trade Representative. But Ecuador refused to render it unenforceable despite an order to do that from an international arbitration tribunal. Letting Ecuador save money on flowers after blatant ""acts of defiance"" would tell the world the U.S. rewards bad behavior, the oil company said. Chevron lost the war of the roses. But it still hasn't paid a cent of the Ecuadorean judgment, and says it won't stop legally battling until it can ensure that it never has to. ""We're going to fight this until hell freezes over, and then we'll fight it on the ice,"" a former Chevron general counsel, Charles James, said before his retirement in 2010, a remark that became a watchword at the company. His successor, R. Hewitt Pate, said this spring that ""only the government of Ecuador could deliver a final resolution of this case,"" by nullifying the verdict. Big companies that see lawsuits against them as unfounded often reach a point, after losing a court ruling or two, when settling seems the sensible course. Chevron never did. Twenty-eight years after the Ecuador case was filed, 10 years after it came to a verdict and seven years after Chevron got a different court to find egregious misbehavior by a plaintiffs' lawyer, Chevron fights onâ€”pressing to make sure that lawyer doesn't profit from the case, hiring attorneys in countries where it operates and where plaintiffs might try to collect, trying to force Ecuador to pay its legal costs and, as with the roses, asking the U.S. government to penalize Ecuador in the trade arena. Chevron's opponents also refuse to back down, making the case what appears to be the oil industry's longest-running legal slugfest. Aspects of it have been heard by some 100 judges in 36 courts in seven countries. By Chevron's estimate, it has cost the company nearly $1 billion, including 1.5 million hours of its staff, advisers' and attorneys' time. Executives and lawyers who worked on the case have retired or died since it began. Although the oil industry's era of global power seems to have peaked, for Chevron part of that eraâ€”costly, intractable environmental-pollution litigationâ€”continues unabated. The Ecuador legal fight has lasted even longer than the one that followed the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska. Well before Chevron lost the damage verdict in 2011, it set out to turn the tables on the litigants. It subpoenaed or sued dozens of people who had helped the plaintiffs' side, legal records show, and unearthed damaging video clips about the plaintiffs' legal team's activities from documentary-film outtakes. Chevron's lawyers obtained the personal notes of the lead plaintiffs' lawyer, Steven Donziger, and used his own words against him. The company scored a seminal victory in 2014 when a federal judge in New York found that Mr. Donziger and others on his team had offered a bribe to a judge in Ecuador and had ghost-written the court verdict. Mr. Donziger's New York law license was revoked. He faces a criminal contempt-of-court trial this month over his refusal to turn over records to Chevron as ordered. His bank accounts were frozen. He has been under house arrest for nearly two years, unable to leave his Manhattan apartment without court permission, an ankle bracelet tracking his every move. In December, Mr. Donziger shouted out his window to supporters gathered below to mark his 500th day of detention. ""What is happening to me is a sign of our success,"" he said, using a bullhorn: ""This is a corporate playbook that is designed really by Chevron and the entire fossil-fuel industry to silence advocacy."" Below his window hung a sign saying ""SOS Free Steven!"" The company's strategy ""is to pulverize me personally, to criminalize me,"" Mr. Donziger said in an interview.

ÃÃ±igo Salvador Crespo, an Ecuador justice official whose agency represents the country in the dispute, declined to comment, saying to do so could compromise its legal strategy. A newly elected president of Ecuador who hasn't yet taken office, Guillermo Lasso, didn't respond to requests for comment on the dispute. Chevron officials say they have punched back so hard, for so long, because they found fraud in the litigation and because Ecuador in the 1990s granted a release from liability after a cleanup. ""This was never for Chevron one of these things where we added up potential liability and said we have to fight this because the number is too much,"" Mr. James, the former general counsel, said in an interview. To some longtime observers of the case, it looks more like a grudge match with Mr. Donziger, who has refused to concede anything despite a series of court losses. ""They're making an example of him,"" said Ted Folkman, an attorney who has closely followed the legal battle. As the years go on, he said, ""it's not being done for reasons that look rational.""

Chevron Corporation,CVX,2021/8/3,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, greenhouse gas emissions","Royal Dutch Shell Potential Big Oil Stock
Of all the Big Oil stocks, Royal Dutch Shell is the one best positioned to deliver a gusher.
Shell also offers investors a safe dividend yield of nearly 5%.
""Shell's shares are materially undervalued based on the company's industry-leading cash flows and strong franchises in liquefied natural gas, retail, and deep-water drilling,"" says Dan Farb, a principal at Mill Pond Capital, a Boston investment firm that holds shares.
Shell trades for eight times projected 2021 earnings of $4.95 a share, compared with a price/earnings ratio of 14 for Exxon and 16 for Chevron.
With similar free cash flow to Exxon, Shell is paying out $7.5 billion in annual dividends, versus $15 billion for its U.S. rival.
Unlike Shell, both Exxon and Chevron maintained their dividends during the pandemic.
Looking to 2022, Royal Dutch Shell is expected to earn over $5 a share and generate $23 billion of free cash flow, slightly above Exxon's.
Related Market Data Commodities & Futures Citing in part Shell's 15% free-cash-flow yield, MKM Partners analyst John Gerdes recently lifted his price target on the RDS.B ADS by $8, to $76 a share.
Christyan Malek, a J.P. Morgan analyst, recently wrote that there was 50% potential upside in Shell, with the stock ""well underpinned"" by an average free-cash flow yield above 15% in 2021 and 2022, assuming crude at $70 a barrel.
In a June post, CEO Ben van Beurden said: ""For a long time to come we expect to continue providing energy in the form of oil and gas products both to meet customer demand, and to maintain a financially strong company."" Given strong anti-fossil fuel sentiment in Europe, Shell carries more risk than its U.S. peers.","Of all the Big Oil stocks, Royal Dutch Shell is the one best positioned to deliver a gusher. The British-Dutch colossus is the most profitable of the major international energy companies, yet it trades at a sharp discount to Exxon Mobil (ticker: XOM) and Chevron (CVX). Shell also offers investors a safe dividend yield of nearly 5%. ""Shell's shares are materially undervalued based on the company's industry-leading cash flows and strong franchises in liquefied natural gas, retail, and deep-water drilling,"" says Dan Farb, a principal at Mill Pond Capital, a Boston investment firm that holds shares. Investors can play Shell through two U.S.-listed shares that are economically equivalent and trade under the tickers RDS.A and RDS.B.

Shell trades for eight times projected 2021 earnings of $4.95 a share, compared with a price/earnings ratio of 14 for Exxon and 16 for Chevron. Shell also has an underappreciated mix of assets, including the largest liquefied natural gas business and the industry's biggest retail franchise. Shell has 46,000 service stationsâ€”more locations than McDonald's (MCD) or Starbucks (SBUX). The retail business alone could be worth $40 billion, or 10 times 2020 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda. That is in line with the valuation of Alimentation Couche-Tard (ANCUF), a Quebec-based operator of more than 14,200 convenience stores, most offering fuel services, largely in the U.S. and Canada. Shell has a market value of $160 billion. Another possibility is a sharply higher dividend. The company has increased its quarterly dividend 50%, to 48 cents a U.S.-listed share, from its 2020 low. Yet the dividend was 94 cents before the pandemic. Shell is aiming for 4% annual growth in the dividend from current levels, but it could do much more. With similar free cash flow to Exxon, Shell is paying out $7.5 billion in annual dividends, versus $15 billion for its U.S. rival. At something close to an Exxon-like payout, Shell would yield 7% to 8%. Unlike Shell, both Exxon and Chevron maintained their dividends during the pandemic. Exxon yields 6.1% and Chevron, 5.3%. ""If management keeps capital expenditures restrained and restores Shell's dividend payout ratio closer to that of its North American peers, shares could rally by over 50%,"" Mill Pond's Farb contends. One intriguing idea, while unlikely, is a breakup of the company. A sum-of-the-parts analysis by Mill Pond would value Shell at about a 70% premium to the current price. Looking to 2022, Royal Dutch Shell is expected to earn over $5 a share and generate $23 billion of free cash flow, slightly above Exxon's. Related Market Data Commodities & Futures Citing in part Shell's 15% free-cash-flow yield, MKM Partners analyst John Gerdes recently lifted his price target on the RDS.B ADS by $8, to $76 a share. He sees $142 billion in total free cash flow from 2021 to 2026, nearly equal to the company's market value, assuming Brent crude oil of $65 a barrel and natural gas at $2.90 for every thousand cubic feet. Brent crude is now $70, and gas is around $4 per thousand cubic feet. Christyan Malek, a J.P. Morgan analyst, recently wrote that there was 50% potential upside in Shell, with the stock ""well underpinned"" by an average free-cash flow yield above 15% in 2021 and 2022, assuming crude at $70 a barrel. He has an Overweight rating on the stock. One reason Shell and BP (BP) trade at discounts to their U.S. peers is that they face greater investor and political pressure to scale back their production of fossil fuels and invest in alternative strategies like wind and solar energy. Royal Dutch Shell is on boardâ€”but it isn't going as far as BP, which is aiming to cut its oil and gas production by 40% by 2030. Shell aims to cut its carbon emissions 20% by 2030 based on a 2016 base and get to zero net emissions by 2050. It is cutting back on some exploration activities and sees a 1% to 2% annual drop in its oil production. Shell has focused on lower carbon-emitting natural gas, with gas projected to rise to 55% of its output from 45% by 2030. Just $2 billion to $3 billion of its roughly $20 billion of annual capital spending is earmarked for renewablesâ€”wind and solar powerâ€”and other clean-energy initiatives. In May, a Dutch court ordered the company to reduce its global carbon emissions by 45% by 2030. The move was hailed by climate activists, but Shell plans to appealâ€”a process that could take two to three years. Royal Dutch Shell management declined to talk to Barron's. In a June post, CEO Ben van Beurden said: ""For a long time to come we expect to continue providing energy in the form of oil and gas products both to meet customer demand, and to maintain a financially strong company."" Given strong anti-fossil fuel sentiment in Europe, Shell carries more risk than its U.S. peers. But that risk is more than offset by a low valuation, a solid yield, the prospect of higher dividends, and maybe a corporate breakup.

The opinions expressed are her own.) By Jennifer Saba NEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters Breakingviews) - When it comes to climate change, Chevron is a big company with small ambitions. The U.S. oil giant on Monday unveiled a plan to cut its greenhouse gas emissions, but it falls short of what peers have promised. Timidity isnâ€™t a virtue when others are being more daring. The $209 billion firm run by Mike Wirth wants to slash emissions that come from its own operations to zero by 2050 and to reduce the intensity of greenhouses gases more broadly â€?including from the fuel products it sells â€?by more than 5% from 2016 levels by 2028. Thatâ€™s something, especially for a firm whose emissions place it near the bottom of the barrel among oil companies, according to Carbon Tracker. Itâ€™s less rigorous than it could be, though. Chevron isnâ€™t committing to reduce the carbon footprint of fuel it sells to airlines over the next three decades. Nor is it promising to achieve emission reduction in absolute terms, choosing instead to rely on lowering carbon in its overall mix. Others are thinking bigger. UK competitor BP has vowed to cut oil production by 40% by 2030. Meanwhile stateside, Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub is pledging net-zero https://www.oxy.com/Sustainability/overview/Documents/ClimateReport2020.pdf emissions, including parts of the value chain outside of Oxyâ€™s control, by 2050. Wirth may just be sticking to what he believes he and his successors can realistically achieve. But his oil competitors think they can be more aggressive and Chevron shareholders are eager to see the company move quickly on this front too.

The pressure will only likely intensify: consider rival Exxon Mobilâ€™s battle with activist Engine No. 1. Wirth has a shield, at least, in Chevronâ€™s valuation. The company trades at a higher multiple of next yearâ€™s forecast EBITDA than BP and Royal Dutch Shell, according to Refinitiv. Investors arenâ€™t obviously restless. If anything, though, that should embolden him to do more than tiptoe around the climate bonfire.

Maloney added that she is prepared to subpoena the directors if they refuse to testify at the hearing, which is scheduled for Feb. 8, after ExxonMobil and Chevron have reported their fourth-quarter earnings.
""We expect all of the directors to show up and answer honestly,"" he said, noting that ""some of them got elected on a climate agenda.""

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has broadened its investigation into the role of fossil fuel companies in misleading the public about climate change, asking members of the boards of directors of ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell Oil to testify before Congress next month about their firms' commitments to curbing global warming.
The latest letters from the Oversight Committee, sent Thursday evening, call on directors at four of America's largest oil and gas companies to testify about whether their firms' commitments to cut emissions are consistent with the Paris climate accord adopted in 2015.
""The hearing is part of the Committee's ongoing investigation into the role of the fossil fuel industry in preventing meaningful action on global warming, including through misrepresenting the scale of industry efforts to address the crisis,"" the letters said.
Maloney (D-N.Y.), who chairs the Oversight Committee and is spearheading the investigation, told The Washington Post that ""boards of directors at fossil fuel companies have a critical role to play in holding management accountable for meaningful emissions reductions that will help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, which is the goal of the Paris accord."" Maloney added that she is prepared to subpoena the directors if they refuse to testify at the hearing, which is scheduled for Feb. 8, after ExxonMobil and Chevron have reported their fourth-quarter earnings.
""We expect all of the directors to show up and answer honestly,"" he said, noting that ""some of them got elected on a climate agenda."" One such director is Alexander ""Andy"" Karsner, an energy executive who was one of three activist investors to win a seat on ExxonMobil's board of directors in May, marking a surprise victory for Engine No. 1, a small activist hedge fund that has pushed the oil giant to adopt a stronger climate stance.
""In a relatively short period of time, we have delivered to the Committee thousands of pages of documents that speak directly to Shell's position on climate change over several decades, our strong support for the Paris Agreement and our efforts to be an industry leader in the transition to a lower-carbon future.""

President Biden acknowledged Wednesday that further cuts to his Build Back Better proposal may be necessary, and climate-fueled extreme weather events are intensifying around the country. Oversight panel members previously grilled the CEOs of the four oil and gas companies, as well as two trade associations they fund, at a historic six-hour hearing in October.

ExxonMobil spokesman Casey Norton said the oil giant has been cooperating with the committee.

""We have to look past the window dressing and really ask, what are these companies actually pledging in terms of getting to net zero? And how are they going to actually achieve that?"" said Rep.

Khanna and Karsner have crossed paths before. The two men had dinner together in Silicon Valley a decade ago, after Khanna's time as deputy assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama. Ten years later, Khanna said he plans to press Karsner on comments made by ExxonMobil's chief executive, Darren Woods, at the last oversight hearing in October. Woods told the panel that the company's past statements about climate change have been consistent with the scientific consensus on global warming. In response, Maloney read aloud statements from one of Woods's predecessors, Lee Raymond, including a 1997 speech in which Raymond said ""the case for so-called global warming is far from airtight."" The speech came after ExxonMobil's own scientists had warned top brass at the company about the dangerous effects of greenhouse gases, including rising sea levels. ExxonMobil has been in the committee's crosshairs since July, when Greenpeace UK released a secretly recorded video of an ExxonMobil lobbyist boasting about the company's efforts to undermine climate science and block climate legislation. Keith McCoy, who at the time thought he was talking to a job recruiter, said the company had relied on ""shadow groups"" to fight climate science and had lobbied influential senators to undercut Biden's climate agenda. Karsner will not be the only board member in the hot seat next month. The Oversight Committee also fired off a letter to Susan Avery, an atmospheric physicist who serves as president emerita of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and was elected to ExxonMobil's board in 2017. To answer for Chevron, Democrats called on Enrique Hernandez Jr., CEO of a security services company who chairs the Chevron board's public policy and sustainability committee. The other two directors called to testify, Melody Meyer of BP and Jane Holl Lute of Shell, also sit on their boards' respective sustainability panels. Chevron, the second-biggest American oil company, announced in October an ""aspiration"" of net-zero emissions from its operations, a move similar to ExxonMobil's pledge.

All it had to do was switch the main biofuel it supplies to power cars and trucks in Californiaâ€”currently a type of natural gas produced with methane emissions from garbageâ€”to a chemically identical gas produced from the manure of cows.
The lowest carbon-intensity scores go to fuels that keep warming gases out of the airâ€”particularly methane, a greenhouse gas that can be 84 times more potent in trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that helps the United Nations evaluate the state of research on the issue.
So capturing the methane from decomposing manure at dairies to make truck fuel cuts net emissions a lot, and reaps some of the best scores of all.
California Bioenergy LLC, which develops projects to make energy out of manure, in 2016 received the first provisional carbon-intensity scoreâ€”around negative 270â€”for a dairy-gas facility.
Its latest project to go online is the 1,500-cow Rib-Arrow Dairy in central California, where manure is now flushed from the floor of the stalls into a covered lagoon, called a digester, so the methane can be collected for processing rather than released into the air.
California-based Chevron has committed around $500 million to develop renewable natural-gas supply, starting with dairies.
""From our perspective, the program is working to drive private investment"" to accomplish the state's environmental goals, said Matthew Botill, the division chief at California's Air Resources Board who oversees the state's low-carbon fuel standard and other climate change programs.
California officials said the program doesn't cost the state money because its market-based mechanism results in producers and consumers of higher-carbon fuels effectively paying the incentives to the producers and consumers of low-carbon fuels.
One dairy that was already using digesters to collect methane and produce electricity from its manureâ€”the 35,000-cow Threemile Canyon Farms in Oregonâ€”got a relatively high carbon-intensity score of negative 189 when it shifted to making gas for California, since it had fewer emissions to reduce.
Financiers at Cresta Fund Management, a Texas-based private-equity fund that has two renewable natural gas producers in its portfolio, said they have seen an increasing number of entrepreneurs with little experience in the area trying to raise money for dairy-gas projects.","Clean Energy Fuels Corp., a major distributor of natural gas made from waste, found a way to boost its earnings by millions of dollars, virtually overnight. All it had to do was switch the main biofuel it supplies to power cars and trucks in Californiaâ€”currently a type of natural gas produced with methane emissions from garbageâ€”to a chemically identical gas produced from the manure of cows. California's clean-fuels grading system gives cow-poop gas a much better scoreâ€”and much higher subsidiesâ€”than landfill gas. So that simple substitution could net Clean Energy an additional $70 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization by 2026, the company estimates. Together with European energy giants BP PLC and TotalEnergies SE, Clean Energy is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into gas production on dairy farms to milk that advantage. A host of developers, financiers and carbon-conscious corporations, from Chevron Corp. to Amazon.com Inc., are looking to buy or produce the fuel as well. ""It is like magic,"" said Andrew Littlefair, Clean Energy's president and chief executive, of the projected earnings boost. The surging interest in dairy renewable natural gas, as it is called, shows how incentives can spur action to address the emissions linked to climate changeâ€”and sometimes unintended consequences as well. Until a few years ago, the gas, which is interchangeable with conventional natural gas and can replace dirtier fuels like diesel, was a niche product that was too expensive to make commercially. Now, California's generous subsidies have prompted what some observers are dubbing a manure gold rush. One developer said he showed up at a dairy only to discover that the farmer had gotten more than 10 pitches for business tie-ups already. Others said competition for business has gotten so heated that some developers are promising to pay farmers a fixed amount per cowâ€”a risky setup if the price of the California credits plummets. Driving the boom is California's Low-Carbon Fuel Standard. The standard requires companies that sell transportation fuels in the state to lower their products' carbon intensityâ€”the carbon dioxide emitted during manufacture, distribution and consumption. Companies that exceed the carbon-intensity maximums have to buy offset credits, each of which represents a metric ton of emissions. Those with low-scoring fuels generate credits, whose price goes up and down depending on demand. The lowest carbon-intensity scores go to fuels that keep warming gases out of the airâ€”particularly methane, a greenhouse gas that can be 84 times more potent in trapping heat than carbon dioxide, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the scientific group that helps the United Nations evaluate the state of research on the issue. Other waste sources such as landfills produce methane, too. But California already requires landfills to curb methane emissions while farms don't have to, and thus they emit more. So capturing the methane from decomposing manure at dairies to make truck fuel cuts net emissions a lot, and reaps some of the best scores of all. U.S. regulators haven't generally imposed controls on methane emissions from livestock, since they are tough to implement and politically sensitive. California Bioenergy LLC, which develops projects to make energy out of manure, in 2016 received the first provisional carbon-intensity scoreâ€”around negative 270â€”for a dairy-gas facility. Diesel by comparison has an average carbon-intensity score of more than 100. CalBio, as it is known, now has 41 dairy-gas projects in operation and another 60-odd projects in development. Its latest project to go online is the 1,500-cow Rib-Arrow Dairy in central California, where manure is now flushed from the floor of the stalls into a covered lagoon, called a digester, so the methane can be collected for processing rather than released into the air. That raw biogas, which is around 60% methane and the remainder mostly carbon dioxide, is piped to a central facility that collects gas from a cluster of dairies in the area and purifies it for injection into the local utility's pipeline. David Ribeiro, a third-generation co-owner of Rib-Arrow, said he had been approached by digester salesmen before, but that adding the gas sales to the environmental benefits finally made everything economically feasible: ""We're like, 'Wow, this makes sense.'"" There are 116 such facilities currently operating in the U.S.â€”more than half of which went online last yearâ€”and another 121 planned or in construction, according to the Coalition for Renewable Natural Gas, a nonprofit that promotes gas made from waste. Analysts say thousands more dairies could support such plants, which can reduce foul odors in addition to capturing emissions. The market is likely to remain small compared with the U.S.'s overall appetite for natural gas in homes, businesses and transport. Even in an optimistic scenario, biogas from manure would supply only around 3% of today's demand by 2040, according to a 2019 study commissioned by the American Gas Foundation. Still, money is pouring in from big companies looking to lower their carbon footprints quicklyâ€”as well as entrepreneurs smelling a business opportunity. Clean Energy said it is working on more than a billion dollars worth of deals through its dairy-gas joint ventures with BP and Total, and that it hopes to channel more than $2 billion in investment by 2026. California-based Chevron has committed around $500 million to develop renewable natural-gas supply, starting with dairies. A Chevron investor presentation in September showed plans for a national network of as many as ""190,000 milking cow equivalents"" and forecast double-digit returns. Amazon has inked a deal with Clean Energy to buy biogas for its massive trucking fleet; it declined to comment. More than half of California's methane is released from dairy and livestock manure, and by cow burps. The state has vowed to lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40% compared with 1990 levels by 2030, and it is focusing on methane reductions in particular. It is also targeting a 20% reduction in the carbon intensity of its transportation fuel relative to 2010, and has so far managed to cut it by more than 7%. ""From our perspective, the program is working to drive private investment"" to accomplish the state's environmental goals, said Matthew Botill, the division chief at California's Air Resources Board who oversees the state's low-carbon fuel standard and other climate change programs. California officials said the program doesn't cost the state money because its market-based mechanism results in producers and consumers of higher-carbon fuels effectively paying the incentives to the producers and consumers of low-carbon fuels. Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia are implementing similar fuel standards, and a number of other states are considering them, too. The federal government issues its own, less-lucrative, subsidies for low-carbon fuels. California's aggressive incentive system is producing some odd results. One dairy that was already using digesters to collect methane and produce electricity from its manureâ€”the 35,000-cow Threemile Canyon Farms in Oregonâ€”got a relatively high carbon-intensity score of negative 189 when it shifted to making gas for California, since it had fewer emissions to reduce. ""The manure management practices on the farm were so goodâ€¦that they were penalized a bit,"" said Ben Vitale, CEO of Resilient Infrastructure Group, which owns Threemile's gas plant. Financiers at Cresta Fund Management, a Texas-based private-equity fund that has two renewable natural gas producers in its portfolio, said they have seen an increasing number of entrepreneurs with little experience in the area trying to raise money for dairy-gas projects. ""We had some authors pitch us,"" said John Skrinar, Cresta's director of sustainable investments. ""The reality is, it's a lot more complicated than just show up, put a swimming pool in the ground, shovel a bunch of cow manure into it, and make a fortune."" At Rib-Arrow Dairy, water used in the methane-capture process is stored in this lagoon. The water will eventually be used for cow feed and fertilizer.

ïƒ?Climate advocates urge senators to oppose Biden's District Court nomineePresident Biden's nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court has garnered high-profile praise from liberal groups.
Activists argue that Rearden is unfit for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench because of her past work for the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which has represented the oil giant Chevron in controversial environmental cases (including fights over oil waste left behind in Ecuador) and also represented the Dakota Access pipeline in Montana.
The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Rearden's nomination on Monday.
When approached by The Climate 202 in the Senate basement yesterday, both Warren and Markey declined to comment on Rearden's nomination, while a spokeswoman for Merkley said in an email that the Oregon Democrat ""hasn't formally taken a position on this nomination yet."" Done with Gibson DunnIn 2011, Gibson Dunn represented Chevron in litigation against Steven Donziger, an environmental and human rights attorney who had won a multibillion-dollar judgment against the oil company over environmental contamination in the Amazon.
""Especially at a time when the Biden administration has failed to accomplish the climate agenda that they promised, nominating a Trump judge from Gibson Dunn sends the wrong signal,"" Tim Hirschel-Burns, the co-founder of Law Students for Climate Accountability and a third-year law student at Yale, told The Climate 202.
Rearden's backersMichael Gerrard, founding director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee in February supporting Rearden's nomination.
Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) has also remained a staunch supporter of Rearden, telling reporters recently that critics have ""misunderstood her role in some litigation that her firm carried."" Gillibrand spokesman Evan Lukaske said in an email to The Climate 202: ""Jennifer Rearden's extensive knowledge of federal law and record of accomplishment will make her a tremendous asset to the Southern District of New York.
Senator Gillibrand was proud to recommend her to the president and expects she will be confirmed.""

The sentence has been updated to clarify that Chevron is not involved with the Dakota Access pipeline. Good morning and welcome to The Climate 202! TGIF and be sure to send us your best April Fools' Day jokes. ïƒ?Climate advocates urge senators to oppose Biden's District Court nomineePresident Biden's nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court has garnered high-profile praise from liberal groups. But some climate and social justice activists are waging a lower-profile campaign to block Biden's nominee for a District Court, citing her past work on behalf of the fossil fuel industry. The campaign targets Jennifer Rearden, whom Biden nominated in January to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, one of the nation's most influential federal trial courts. She was tapped by President Donald Trump in February 2020 but was not confirmed by the Senate. Activists argue that Rearden is unfit for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench because of her past work for the law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, which has represented the oil giant Chevron in controversial environmental cases (including fights over oil waste left behind in Ecuador) and also represented the Dakota Access pipeline in Montana. The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to vote on Rearden's nomination on Monday. While the panel is widely expected to advance her nomination, a coalition of more than 200 public interest organizations â€?including environmental groups such as 350.org, Greenpeace USA and the Sunrise Movement â€?is urging senators to oppose the nomination on the floor. According to a person familiar with the matter, six senators are still wavering over whether to support Rearden on the floor. They are Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) and Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), according to the individual, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the sensitive political deliberations. If all six senators decide to oppose Rearden on the floor, Democratic leadership would need to wrangle support from Republicans, who might find Rearden palatable because she originally was nominated by Trump. Moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Wednesday said she would back Jackson for the Supreme Court, giving the White House at least a minimally bipartisan vote. In an interview with The Climate 202 yesterday, Ossoff, a member of the Judiciary Committee, declined to say whether he planned to back Rearden on Monday. ""I will vote to confirm Judge Jackson for the Supreme Court, and I will complete additional due diligence for the other nominees who are scheduled for Monday between now and the markup,"" he said. When approached by The Climate 202 in the Senate basement yesterday, both Warren and Markey declined to comment on Rearden's nomination, while a spokeswoman for Merkley said in an email that the Oregon Democrat ""hasn't formally taken a position on this nomination yet."" Done with Gibson DunnIn 2011, Gibson Dunn represented Chevron in litigation against Steven Donziger, an environmental and human rights attorney who had won a multibillion-dollar judgment against the oil company over environmental contamination in the Amazon. While Rearden was not a lead counsel in the Donziger litigation, she was involved in at least 37 billable hours of work on the case, for which Chevron was charged more than $30,000, records show. ""As fossil fuel-caused superstorms, fires, droughts, and other disasters kill people and ravage the planet, Gibson Dunn is one of the firms most prominently defending fossil fuel producers from efforts to hold them accountable,"" said a recent letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) from organizations opposing Rearden's nomination. One signatory of the letter was Law Students for Climate Accountability, a group of climate-conscious students at law schools across the country. ""Especially at a time when the Biden administration has failed to accomplish the climate agenda that they promised, nominating a Trump judge from Gibson Dunn sends the wrong signal,"" Tim Hirschel-Burns, the co-founder of Law Students for Climate Accountability and a third-year law student at Yale, told The Climate 202. A Gibson Dunn spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Rearden's backersMichael Gerrard, founding director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School, sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee in February supporting Rearden's nomination. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) has also remained a staunch supporter of Rearden, telling reporters recently that critics have ""misunderstood her role in some litigation that her firm carried."" Gillibrand spokesman Evan Lukaske said in an email to The Climate 202: ""Jennifer Rearden's extensive knowledge of federal law and record of accomplishment will make her a tremendous asset to the Southern District of New York. Senator Gillibrand was proud to recommend her to the president and expects she will be confirmed."" Pressure points Biden announces significant strategic oil reserve release to curb gas pricesPresident Biden on Thursday announced the release of 1 million barrels a day over the next six months from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve â€?an effort to make up for the loss of Russian oil from global markets amid the war in Ukraine and to cut the cost of gas, The Washington Post's Steven Mufson and Cleve R. Wootson Jr. report. The release â€?which will hit the market in May, according to a senior administration official â€?marks the largest withdrawal in the reserve's more than 46-year history. It comes as some congressional committees are calling on oil executives to testify about rising gas prices despite high profits for the industry. ""It's not the time to sit on record profits. It's time to step up for the good of your country,"" Biden said Thursday in remarks at the White House. He also said he would adopt a ""use it or lose it"" policy to make oil and gas companies pay for drilling leases that are being left idle rather than explored. Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) told The Climate 202 on Thursday that the release won't undermine the nation's long-term transition to clean energy. ""It gives us an opportunity to protect consumers in the short term, while we put in place a long-term, clean-energy, all-electric-vehicle strategy â€?and reduce and ultimately eliminate our need to put oil into gasoline vehicles in the United States,"" he said. Here's more from Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.): On the Hill House panel to grill Postal Service on gas-powered trucks contractThe House Oversight and Reform Committee on Thursday announced it will hold a hearing on the Postal Service's decision to buy about 148,000 gas-guzzling delivery trucks despite calls from the Biden administration to transition to an electric federal fleet, The Washington Post's Jacob Bogage reports. The hearing, to be held Tuesday, will focus on the agency's ""next generation delivery vehicles"" that are scheduled to hit the road in 2023. The agency will spend about $11.3 billion on the new trucks from Oshkosh Defense over the next decade to replace its aging fleet, but only 10 percent of the new vehicles will be electric. The Postal Service's plan locks in gas-powered trucks for at least the next 20 years, falling well behind the White House's goal of moving the entire federal civilian fleet to electric by 2035. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country, and Postal Service vehicles make up the biggest share of the government's civilian fleet. Victoria Stephen, head of the Postal Service's ""next generation delivery vehicles,"" or NGDV program, and Postal Service Inspector General Tammy Whitcomb will testify before the panel, Committee Chair Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.) said Thursday. Sens. Cramer and Coons urge Biden, European Commission to consider climate in trade dealsSens. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) and Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) today sent a letter to President Biden urging him to work with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to consider climate in trade deals. ""To be successful, we must focus on the long-term opportunity to bolster our trade relationships with nations who prioritize clean, innovative energy sources,"" the senators wrote in the letter. The letter comes a week after the Biden administration and the European Commission announced plans to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian energy by sending additional shipments of liquefied natural gas to Europe amid Russia's continued attack on Ukraine. Cramer has also advocated for a carbon border fee, which would slap a tax on imports from countries that aren't taking aggressive steps to cut greenhouse gas emissions. International climate U.N. unveils group to assess companies' net zero pledgesThe United Nations on Thursday announced it will unveil a group of 16 experts to review corporate pledges to reach net-zero emissions, an effort to ensure that companies deliver on their promises and prevent greenwashing, Valerie Volcovici of Reuters reports. ""Despite growing pledges of action, global emissions are at an all-time high,"" said U.N. Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres. ""Tougher net-zero standards and strengthened accountability around the implementation of these commitments can deliver real and immediate emissions cuts."" The group, which was launched at the U.N. climate summit in Scotland in November, comes as environmental groups sue companies that lack details about their emissions plans and as regulators begin to question corporate climate commitments. Agency alert Rule will require valves on new pipelines to stave off disastersThe Transportation Department on Monday finalized a rule that requires companies to install emergency valves on new pipelines, Matthew Brown reports for the Associated Press. The decision comes in response to a fatal gas explosion in California as well as massive oil spills in Michigan, among other states. The valves can quickly shut off the flow of oil, natural gas or other hazardous fuels when pipelines rupture. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the rule could also prevent large leaks of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

But it's unclear whether the bipartisan energy group will agree on a legislative framework before July 4. And Democrats appear on track to blow past a self-imposed Memorial Day deadline for striking a deal on their stalled reconciliation package. Manchin told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that attendees discussed boosting U.S. exports of oil and natural gas, which proponents argue are cleaner than fossil fuels produced overseas. ""With the war in Ukraine â€?the world's counting on us,"" he said, adding, ""What's our ability to produce? How can we reduce our emissions â€?as we replace some of the dirtier products?"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), another participant, acknowledged that the bipartisan talks may not yield legislation. ""The question is whether we will ever have a bill, or whether instead there will be a move to reconciliation for those items that the Democrats agree on,"" he said. Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) told reporters that he thinks the bipartisan conversations will continue until July 4. He also expressed skepticism of federal tax credits for electric vehicles â€?a subsidy that Manchin has previously criticized. Senate panel deadlocks on gas price-gouging banMembers of the Senate Commerce Committee on Wednesday deadlocked 14-14 on a bill that would increase fines for companies that manipulate gasoline prices, Kellie Lunney and Lilliana Byington report for Bloomberg News. The Transportation Fuel Market Transparency Act, similar to legislation the House narrowly passed last week, marks Democrats' latest attempt to blame soaring gas prices on oil companies. A tie means that the bill won't advance out of the committee unless Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) files a discharge petition to send it to the floor. Schumer has said he wants the Senate to vote on the legislation, although the bill is not expected to garner enough Republican support to pass. Senate confirms head of EPA's research officeThe Senate on Wednesday voted 51-43 to confirm Christopher Frey as assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development. Frey, a former North Carolina State University professor who was critical of the EPA's handling of science under former President Donald Trump, overcame opposition from some Republicans. In a speech on the Senate floor, Environment and Public Works Chair Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) praised him as ""an outstanding public servant"" and ""a deeply respected scientist."" Agency alert EPA proposes protections for world's biggest sockeye salmon fisheryThe Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday announced that it will protect Alaskan waters home to one of the world's largest salmon spawning grounds, potentially putting an end to a decade-long battle between Alaska Natives and mining interests in Bristol Bay, The Washington Post's Dino Grandoni reports. If finalized, the EPA's action would deal a potentially fatal blow to the proposed Pebble Mine for gold, copper and other metals. The agency relied on a rarely used authority under the Clean Water Act to conclude that the mine would destroy 8.5 miles of streams and lead to ""unacceptable"" injury to the region's salmon. SEC unveils proposals to stamp out 'greenwashing'The Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday unveiled a pair of rule changes to crack down on companies' unfounded claims about their environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) credentials and to standardize the disclosure process, Katanga Johnson and Ross Kerber report for Reuters. The proposals, which are in a public comment period, come as ESG labels are rising in popularity, causing regulators and activists to express concern that companies are misleading shareholders about the sustainability of their products â€?a practice known as ""greenwashing."" According to an SEC official, the proposals would prevent firms from using an ESG label if it is not central to investment decisions. Pressure points Al Gore rips Congress for stalling on climate, gun controlFormer vice president Al Gore on Wednesday criticized Congress for failing to pass comprehensive gun control legislation in the wake of a mass shooting at an elementary school in Texas, drawing a parallel with lawmakers' seeming inability to pass major climate legislation since President Biden's Build Back Better bill was put on hold in December, the Associated Press reports. ""Our democracy has been paralyzed, bought, captured,"" Gore said during a climate panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""It has to stop."" Corporate commitments Corporations promise to 'buy green' at DavosOn the third day of the World Economic Forum, a global ""buyers' club"" of more than 50 companies, including Microsoft and Ford Motor, pledged to purchase aluminum, steel and other products made with processes that have little to no carbon footprint by 2030, Lisa Friedman reports for the New York Times. The sectors involved in the First Movers Coalition are responsible for about 30 percent of global emissions â€?a figure that is expected to rise to nearly 50 percent by midcentury if left unchecked. Their joint announcement is intended to increase demand for sustainable versions of materials that are otherwise difficult to make without significant emissions.

        <Matched Summary>: Investors reject climate proposals targeting ExxonMobil, ChevronNearly two-thirds of investors in ExxonMobil and Chevron on Wednesday rejected proposals for the oil giants to align their climate strategies with the Paris agreement.
At ExxonMobil's meeting, around 28 percent of investors voted in favor of a proposal from the Dutch climate activist group Follow This, while roughly 33 percent of Chevron's investors backed the resolution.
Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This, told The Climate 202 that he was grateful for the support from nearly one-third of investors, which he said represents a small but significant minority.
""And the only thing we can do now is work with these investors to convince the rest."" ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods urged investors to reject Follow This's resolution at the meeting, saying it would curtail energy supplies at the height of the supply crunch related to the war in Ukraine.
Activists notch smaller winsAbout 52 percent of ExxonMobil shareholders did approve, however, a resolution calling on the company to issue an audited report assessing the impact of a net-zero emissions world on its financial statements.
""We're glad the majority of shareholders agreed with us."" Nearly 98 percent of investors also approved a resolution from Mercy Investment Services requiring the board to issue a report on ""the reliability of Chevron's methane emission disclosures."" Mary Minette, Mercy's director of shareholder advocacy, said in an email that she was ""very pleased"" to see investors recognize the importance of ""accurate and transparent measurement"" of methane, a powerful planet-warming pollutant.
""We are pleased that the overwhelming majority of shareholders continue to support Shell, our energy transition strategy and the progress we have made in the past 12 months,"" Shell CEO Ben van Beurden said of the voting results.
And that means that they will continue to endanger people's lives."" A Shell spokeswoman said in an email that the court decision unfairly targeted one firm, rather than requiring every oil major to slash emissions.
""The Milieudefensie ruling imposes regulation against one company without setting clear policy and regulatory framework needed to drive change across the global energy system.""

The main events described in the summary are the rejection of climate proposals by ExxonMobil and Chevron investors, the approval of a resolution by ExxonMobil shareholders, and the approval of a resolution by Chevron investors. These events are related to the impacts of climate change and global pollution on communities, landscapes, and health, as well as the economic impact of these issues.

is planning to sell its current headquarters in California and is offering to cover costs for some employees to relocate to Texas, the latest move by a large U.S. employer to reduce the size of its offices.
The second-largest U.S. oil company said it would remain based in California, its home state for more than 140 years, but will be leaving its Chevron Park campus in San Ramon, Calif., its global headquarters for two decades.

The second-largest U.S. oil company said it would remain based in California, its home state for more than 140 years, but will be leaving its Chevron Park campus in San Ramon, Calif., its global headquarters for two decades. Chevron said it would cover moving costs for employees who voluntarily opt to move to Houston, as it determines the extent to which it will reduce its staffing in the Golden State. It said it is looking for a new, smaller space to lease in San Ramon, in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, and expects to move from its existing headquarters in late 2023. Chevron's presence in Houston, where it occupies the former Enron Corp. headquarters in the heart of downtown, has been growing in recent years, while its footprint in California has been shrinking. The Houston office now employs nearly 6,000 people, roughly three times as many as the population of the California headquarters, which has been declining after the company began a reorganization in 2019. A spokesman for Chevron said the current real-estate market offers the company an opportunity to adjust its office-space needs. Many U.S. businesses are reconsidering their headquarters' spaces as they contemplate a future of hybrid home-and-office work, and weigh the potential benefits of moving more of their operations to states with lower taxes and costs of living. Chevron's plans to decamp from its current headquarters follow similar recent moves by several large U.S. companies, including machinery giant Caterpillar Inc., aerospace company Boeing Co., defense contractor Raytheon Technologies Corp. and Chevron's closest rival, Exxon Mobil Corp., which is moving its headquarters outside of Dallas to Houston next year. On the Move A closer look at other headquarters moves by large U.S. companies, as selected by WSJ editors. * Caterpillar to Move Global Headquarters to Texas From Illinois (June 14) * Raytheon Moving Headquarters to Washington, D.C., Area (June 7) * Boeing Plans to Move Headquarters to Arlington, Va., From Chicago (May 5) * Exxon to Move Headquarters to Houston (Jan. 31) Exxon's center of gravity had drifted from Irving, Texas, to the Houston area a few years ago when it opened a campus in Spring, Texas, large enough to house 10,000 workers. In January, Exxon said it would move its headquarters to the Spring location as part of a reorganization of its businesses. Boeing and Caterpillar recently said they would leave the Chicago area and move their headquarters to Arlington, Va., and Irving, Texas, respectively. Raytheon said it is relocating to Arlington from Waltham, Mass. Billionaire Ken Griffin's hedge-fund firm Citadel said this week that it would move from Chicago to Miami. Chevron, one of the descendants of the Standard Oil monopoly, has had its headquarters in the greater Bay Area since the early days of its first corporate ancestor, Pacific Coast Oil Co., in 1879. It moved hundreds of employees to San Ramon in 1999, and in 2001 said it would become the company's headquarters. Some of Chevron's executives have long wanted to move the company's headquarters to Texas, but its leadership has held off, largely because of the company's long history in California and its assets there, such as its Richmond, Calif., refinery, according to people familiar with the matter. California lawmakers have previously considered imposing a severance tax that would tax oil production in the state. If California were to impose such a tax, that would likely prompt Chevron to reconsider keeping its headquarters in the state, one of the people said. In recent decades, Houston has become the capital of the U.S. oil and natural-gas industry, with Texas leaders including Gov. Greg Abbott and former Gov. Rick Perry touting lower taxes and a lighter regulatory burden on businesses compared with California and other states. Texas doesn't have a state income tax and its real estate is generally less expensive than in California. The sale of Chevron's nearly 100-acre campus in San Ramon will likely attract plenty of interest from the area's life-sciences industry or developers looking to build high-end apartments and retail stores, said Trent Barmby, a California-based senior managing director at commercial property firm Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. ""It's a generational redevelopment opportunity and it almost certainly won't stay in its current form,"" Mr. Barmby said.

The second-largest U.S. oil company closed the sale Wednesday of its Chevron Park campus in San Ramon, Calif., its global headquarters for two decades, to Sunset Development Co. The family-run company had originally sold the 92-acre parcel to Chevron in the early 1980s. Sunset Chief Executive Alex Mehran Jr. said Chevron also signed a lease for nearly 400,000 square feet of space in a nearby office building located in Sunset's Bishop Ranch mixed-use project in San Ramon. Chevron's office space there could house about 2,000 employees after interior construction finishes in late 2023, Sunset said. The financial terms of the sale and the lease agreement weren't disclosed. A Chevron spokesman said the current real-estate market gave the company an opportunity to downsize its office space to the size its employee base there requires.

Chevron had said earlier this year that it would offer to cover costs for some employees to relocate to Houston. Mr. Reddall said about 200 employees elected to move to Houston since Chevron made that offer earlier in the summer. Mr. Mehran, whose company has worked with Chevron for decades, said that many people have wrongly predicted for years that Chevron would move its actual headquarters to Houston, and that its most recent real-estate investment in the leased space in San Ramon shows the company intends to remain based in California. ""It's the most written-about story that has never happened,"" Mr. Mehran said of the idea Chevron will decamp from California for Houston. ""As much as they can be more efficient in Houston, they have an enduring presence in California."" Houston has become the capital of the U.S. oil-and-natural-gas industry over the past several decades, with Texas leaders including Gov. Greg Abbott touting lower taxes and a lighter regulatory burden on businesses compared with California and other states.

Mary Boroughs, president of Chevron Environmental Management and Real Estate Company, said the company's move to a new, modern leased space will offer an improved employee experience in a more contemporary environment. Chevron's move follows recent similar decisions by other large U.S. companies to downsize their main offices.

Disney,DIS,2018/6/20,tax optimization,"Disney Turns Video Games Theme Park Lines Fun
The ""Play Disney Parks"" app, which launched June 30 and is only playable in Disney theme parks, is the first product from the Imagineers and The Walt Disney Company's digital guest experience division that aims to capitalize on the game development bandwidth inside the company (Disney Interactive was also involved) and the ubiquity of gaming in today's world.
Anyone who's been to Walt Disney World Resort's The Magic Kingdom or Epcot over the past ten years or so has seen the direction Imagineering has been steering the guest experience, blending video game role-playing experiences with real world attractions.
Ackley is best known in the video game world for his work at LucasArts, developing classic PC games in the 1990s ""Day of the Tentacle,"" ""Sam & Max Hit the Road,"" ""Full Throttle,"" ""The Dig"" and ""The Curse of Monkey Island."" Since 2001, Ackley has been gamifying experiences at Disney theme parks, including the wildly popular Sorcerer's of the Magic Kingdon collectible card game that unlocks animated storytelling and motion-sensored gameplay at hidden kiosks throughout the Orlando theme park, and Disney Cruise Lines' Midship Detective Agency, which uses motion-sensored playing cards to reveal interactivity across ""enchanted pictures"" throughout the cruise ships feature Mickey Mouse and the gang, as well as The Muppets.
""When you think about the history of Imagineering storytelling over 60 years, it's about creating truly immersive places where guests can step into fantastic worlds, meet characters they love and connect with the people they're with, and Play Disney Parks is a natural extension of that original vision by leveraging the latest and greatest in technology to bring those worlds to life and give our guests an active role in the story,"" Gorin added.
Dan Soto vice president of the digital experience at The Walt Disney Company told Variety that over 90% of guests visiting Disney theme parks bring a smartphone along for vacation.
It's this ""tipping point"" that has paved the way to introduce video games designed to be played while waiting in line at specific attractions throughout the four Disney World parks and two Disneyland parks in the U.S.
So whether it be Magic Bands, which we introduced back in 2014, or the My Disney Experience app, all of those things have been all about how do we make your guest experience much more simple and seamless."" Even inside the queues for rides, Disney has been integrating video games for fans to interact with to help distract from the lines.
But the new app allows us to unlock new models of gameplay through the ability to scale and introduce new games to the guest experience."" And gamifying the theme park experience is something that's easy to connect with the wide array of visitors that vacation at Disney properties.
We've experimented with that before outside of the app, but now we've brought that onto our platform where we can do that in a much more scalable way and really make the parks feel alive and dynamic and keep track of your profile and achievements in a way that makes you feel you've taken on a meaningful role in this story."" Toy Story Land includes two new games that are available while waiting in line for the Slinky Dog Dash rollercoaster or Toy Story Midway Mania dark ride.
(Disney Interactive actually released a console video game version from Papaya Studio called Toy Story Mania back in 2009.) All of the games being designed for the app offer hand-the-phone-to-the-next-player multiplayer experiences on purpose, according to Gorin, even though traditional mobile games connect online.
So the experiences were designed to get people looking up and interacting with the world and interacting with each other using the gyroscope and sensors that today's smartphones have."" Soto points to a moment in the Space Mountain game where guests are completing mini quests to level up their ships by looking around the queue for power-ups and competing against other guests.
At Disney we have this amazing physical immersive brick-and-mortar experience that gives us a built-in advantage to really pay off some things in a pretty special way with this achievements platform."" ""Our guests come to the parks again and again because there are new secrets to discover and they get to experience all new things, and the power of an achievements platform like the one in Play Disney Parks is the opportunity for guests to recognize that discovery as they explore the parks and unlock new things to be recognized for that with these digital goods that they can then share online,"" Gorin added.","LOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - When a new attraction opens at a Disney theme park, actually getting on the ride can take a lot of patience. James Cameron's Pandora: The World of Avatar debuted last May at Disney's Animal Kingdom and lines for Avatar: Flight of Passage can still exceed two hours without a FastPass+, which are always in short supply. The new Toy Story Land, which opened June 30, features a new Slinky Dog Dash roller coaster that has Pixar fans waiting five hours in line. While Walt Disney Imagineering can't do anything about the Florida heat, humidity or rain, it can make wait times more manageable. And the key to keeping Disney fans occupied while visiting U.S. theme parks is video games. While taking in Andy's backyard from a toy-sized perspective in Toy Story Land, guests can play Andy's Board Game Blast, a digital take on a classic family board game that's been designed to pass the phone around for multiplayer interactivity. The ""Play Disney Parks"" app, which launched June 30 and is only playable in Disney theme parks, is the first product from the Imagineers and The Walt Disney Company's digital guest experience division that aims to capitalize on the game development bandwidth inside the company (Disney Interactive was also involved) and the ubiquity of gaming in today's world. Imagineering has always incorporated experts from across the entertainment and technology landscapes. With the rise of video gaming over the past three decades, the group has seen an influx of game developers join its ranks. Over the past decade, the concept of ""gamer"" has grown to incorporate the majority of people across the globe - and the guests that visit Disney's theme parks around the world. Anyone who's been to Walt Disney World Resort's The Magic Kingdom or Epcot over the past ten years or so has seen the direction Imagineering has been steering the guest experience, blending video game role-playing experiences with real world attractions. Disney's Kim Possible: World Showcase Adventure debuted in 2006 and offered guests flip phones to go on a secret mission that unlocked interactivity with animatronic characters hidden in plain sight. In 2012, that attraction gave way to Phineas & Ferb's Agent P World Showcase Adventure, which incorporated an AT&T sponsored FONE (Field Operative Notification Equipment) for interactivity. The new Play Disney Parks has integrated Agent P into the app, which unlocks at Epcot. Jonathan Ackley, executive creative director at Walt Disney Imagineering, is one of the game developer minds behind these experiences. Ackley is best known in the video game world for his work at LucasArts, developing classic PC games in the 1990s ""Day of the Tentacle,"" ""Sam & Max Hit the Road,"" ""Full Throttle,"" ""The Dig"" and ""The Curse of Monkey Island.""

Josh Gorin, executive R&D Imagineer at The Walt Disney Company, told Variety that the free iOS and Android app offers the chance to extend that interactive storytelling layer into the guest pocket, leveraging the incredible power of this basic super computer that they're carrying around and turn it from a distraction from the experience into something that enhances it. ""When you think about the history of Imagineering storytelling over 60 years, it's about creating truly immersive places where guests can step into fantastic worlds, meet characters they love and connect with the people they're with, and Play Disney Parks is a natural extension of that original vision by leveraging the latest and greatest in technology to bring those worlds to life and give our guests an active role in the story,"" Gorin added.

""Our world is changing. We walk around with our smartphones all day long and have this thirst and demand for real-time information, for customizing and personalizing experiences, for leveraging technology to create a simple and seamless sort of consumer experience. So whether it be Magic Bands, which we introduced back in 2014, or the My Disney Experience app, all of those things have been all about how do we make your guest experience much more simple and seamless."" Even inside the queues for rides, Disney has been integrating video games for fans to interact with to help distract from the lines. In 2014, Seven Dwarfs Mine Train opened at New Fantasyland at the Magic Kingdom with touch screen displays offering multiplayer ""Bejeweled""-style gaming. ""We've been exploring how to leverage interactive technology to even make your wait time experience feel better and more immersive,"" Soto added. ""Mine Train is a good example of where we have more physical kiosk-based interactive experiences. Haunted Mansion has some fantastic props within the queue that allow you to interact. But the new app allows us to unlock new models of gameplay through the ability to scale and introduce new games to the guest experience."" And gamifying the theme park experience is something that's easy to connect with the wide array of visitors that vacation at Disney properties. According to Statista, in 2017 The Magic Kingdom attracted 20.45 million guests, Disney Animal Kingdom drew 12.5 million visitors, Epcot saw 12.2 million attendees and Disney Hollywood Studios saw 10.7 million vacationers. Disneyland's California parks lured another 18.3 million visitors last year. ""At Imagineering we're all about telling stories by bringing these spectacular worlds to life, and then our guests get to step inside them and take on a role,"" Gorin explained. ""So it's really interesting when you combine more traditional production and scenic disciplines with game design because now you're giving that guest an active role in the story. They're not a passive participant. They're able to take on a character or a persona or even just be themselves, but make meaningful choices that matter and interact with the world in a way they couldn't before."" Disney has been working with Disney Interactive as well as game developers across mobile, alternate reality, live action role-playing space and alternative narrative space to develop the app. Soto said the goal was to transform the smartphone from being a distraction from the story and the people you're with into an enhancement. ""These games were designed to get guest looking up and around and engaging with the world around you, and most importantly the people you came with,"" Soto added. ""It almost turns the phone into a remote control for the park. It becomes your interface, your prop, as you navigate these spaces. And in a lot of these queue games you actually have the ability to trigger and interact with real physical effects. We've experimented with that before outside of the app, but now we've brought that onto our platform where we can do that in a much more scalable way and really make the parks feel alive and dynamic and keep track of your profile and achievements in a way that makes you feel you've taken on a meaningful role in this story."" Toy Story Land includes two new games that are available while waiting in line for the Slinky Dog Dash rollercoaster or Toy Story Midway Mania dark ride. Andy's Board Game Blast offers a multiplayer board game experience, while Toy Story Midway is a collection of multiplayer mini-games that eventually interact with physical elements of the queue before guests board the ride, which itself is a 4D shooter featuring the cast from the Pixar films. (Disney Interactive actually released a console video game version from Papaya Studio called Toy Story Mania back in 2009.) All of the games being designed for the app offer hand-the-phone-to-the-next-player multiplayer experiences on purpose, according to Gorin, even though traditional mobile games connect online. ""As we were designing these activities especially for the queues, we wanted to create something that was completely distinct from other mobile games,"" Gorin said. ""We wanted to avoid that nose down experience. We went for a family game night vibe, not a mobile gaming vibe. So the experiences were designed to get people looking up and interacting with the world and interacting with each other using the gyroscope and sensors that today's smartphones have."" Soto points to a moment in the Space Mountain game where guests are completing mini quests to level up their ships by looking around the queue for power-ups and competing against other guests. At the end of the line, guests can see their ships racing around. Achievements both inside these games and across the theme park attractions will be built out over time, tapping into the popular video game concept of accomplishing goals and then sharing them with the world. ""We're so excited about what digital achievements can do within the park, and it's not even just the obvious things like I rode Aerosmith's Rock'n'Rollercoaster or I scored a high score on this particular game,"" Soto explained. ""We think there are opportunities to do fascinating things in terms of combining achievements like experiencing 7 Gs in one day, which would require riding Mission: Space and Test Track in Epcot. We think there are so many opportunities to unlock the achievement platform and even introduce a whole new layer of physical experiences for guests by virtue of having that achievement. At Disney we have this amazing physical immersive brick-and-mortar experience that gives us a built-in advantage to really pay off some things in a pretty special way with this achievements platform."" ""Our guests come to the parks again and again because there are new secrets to discover and they get to experience all new things, and the power of an achievements platform like the one in Play Disney Parks is the opportunity for guests to recognize that discovery as they explore the parks and unlock new things to be recognized for that with these digital goods that they can then share online,"" Gorin added. Soto said it would be easy to quickly add the type of collectible pins that are a staple in the real world to the app as virtual achievement pins. The app will eventually add a leaderboard for guests to see where their video game and in-park achievements rank against others, according to Gorin. ""We want to grow and expand this platform in a major way, and social gaming and interconnected gameplay is something that we're absolutely super excited about,"" Gorin said. The Walt Disney World Resort has over twenty hotels on property and four theme parks in Orlando alone. ""We think the opportunities to expand this platform well beyond our theme parks, maybe even connecting across different theme parks around the world is a big opportunity for us in the future,"" Soto said. Disney has aggressive plans to expand its parks around the globe. In the U.S. alone there's a new Mickey and Minnie Runaway Train ride coming to Disney Hollywood Studios in 2018, followed by Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge at Disneyland and Disney Hollywood Studios in fall 2018. ""As you start to think about new lands and actually building this interactive layer into the fabric of the land from the very start, that's really compelling,"" Gorin said. ""We're already hard at work with the Star Wars"" Galaxy's Edge team to integrate this technology and this form of gameplay into that land so that when our guests do encounter Black Spire Outpost, they will find the Play Disney Parks app a very important tool for navigating that place and interacting with its population.""","<Incident Category>: tax optimization

Disney,DIS,2019/4/4,"discrimination in employment, gender inequality","Disney-Fox film executives smile joint presentation, concealing tension
LAS VEGAS â€?Alan Horn, head of Walt Disney Studios, couldn't stop crowing about what could be accomplished now that his company had absorbed Twentieth Century Fox.
""Well, I have to say we've put together some sizzle reels in my day, but that one just blows me away,"" Horn said Wednesday after a clip montage showcasing movies from both studios played at the theater-owner convention CinemaCon.
""The storied history and the future represented in that reel â€?together we will be more than the sum of our parts."" But Emma Watts, one of the highest-ranking Fox executives to join Disney, couldn't resist pointing out the underlying weirdness.
""So it's a bit of a shock to be here as colleagues."" Disney formally completed its $71.3 billion acquisition of Fox two weeks ago, bringing into the fold some of the highest-profile movies ever made and a stream of promising titles still in the pipeline, as the presentation at this annual entertainment-business rite Wednesday made clear.
But figuring out where Fox fits into Disney's noisy, crowded ecosystem â€?the on-the-ground business of combining distinct moviemaking philosophies and personalities â€?will be far trickier, as the presentation also made clear.

But Emma Watts, one of the highest-ranking Fox executives to join Disney, couldn't resist pointing out the underlying weirdness. ""We've stood as competitors on this stage for many years,"" Watts said, taking the podium just a few minutes after Horn to present her side of the slate. ""So it's a bit of a shock to be here as colleagues."" Disney formally completed its $71.3 billion acquisition of Fox two weeks ago, bringing into the fold some of the highest-profile movies ever made and a stream of promising titles still in the pipeline, as the presentation at this annual entertainment-business rite Wednesday made clear. But figuring out where Fox fits into Disney's noisy, crowded ecosystem â€?the on-the-ground business of combining distinct moviemaking philosophies and personalities â€?will be far trickier, as the presentation also made clear. At a large casino-set venue, Disney spotlighted some of its biggest coming bets, offering on-screen teasers to films that will soon take in billions of dollars worldwide to the very theater owners key to that effort. There was a fresh all-hands planning session from the ""Avengers: Endgame"" team and a lively musical number from Will Smith in the live-action ""Aladdin,"" a quiet bonding moment for Simba and Mufasa in ""The Lion King"" and a full 17 minutes of new footage from ""Toy Story 4."" There was also material shown from three Fox releases. Watts, Fox vice chairman and production president, touted them: ""Stuber,"" an R-rated buddy action-comedy; the latest X-Men movie, ""Dark Phoenix""; and a big-budget star-driven spectacle, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" which centers on the U.S. automaker's 1960s fight to beat the Italian giant at the Le Mans auto race. ""It takes us back to a time when we dream the impossible and  to make it happen."" Watts said of the final film showcased. ""In this time of change for all of us, of new horizons, this is a fitting film to leave with."" The sheer volume of what the merger has created was felt often. When Cathleen Taff, Disney's head of distribution, showed the room logos of some two dozen of the combined company's coming releases â€?""Frozen 2"" and ""Star Wars: Episode IX"" also among them â€?the screen overflowed with names, causing the room to titter. But all that tonnage doesn't tell of the tension. Even after significant layoffs, there remains questions about how scores of Fox employees who've stayed will fit into areas of marketing, production and publicity, to cover one issue. Among the biggest Dumbos in the room was the matter of Elizabeth Gabler and her Fox 2000 banner. The label made some of most high-upside movies at Fox, mid-budget dramas and comedies that when they broke out, broke out big. Some of Gabler's handiwork, such as ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" were seen in the opening sizzle reel. But the division was not as fortunate: It was revealed several weeks ago that, contrary to long-held belief, the unit would not be joining Disney after the acquisition. Tension was also manifest via other absences. At CinemaCon just 11 months ago, Fox presented what would turn out to be its final slate as a nearly century-old company. Executives promoted new movies such as the recently released ""Alita: Battle Angel"" and wound down with a montage of classic movies and live trumpeters playing the signature, and now suddenly mournful, Fox theme. The studio's chief, Stacey Snider, gave an impassioned speech on the history of Fox and the future of film in a digitized, Netflixized and, yes, Disney-Foxified world. Snider was not in evidence Wednesday, having transitioned out of the company several months ago. But some of her successes, notably ""Bohemian Rhapsody,"" were championed by Disney as among their prized releases of 2018, a display of the Hollywood axiom that if you buy it, you made it. There are also practical questions. After Taff showed those logos, she admitted, semi-sheepishly, Disney has yet to figure all this out. ""A couple of films do share the same release dates,"" she said. She promised more ""updates"" in the weeks ahead. Maybe most of all, it was unclear where Fox movies would fit in spiritually â€?whether there would be room for new ones not yet produced. Leaving aside Fox Searchlight, the prestige division Disney has made clear it wants to empower (it paid tribute Wednesday to Searchlight's many past hits, which include ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" ""The Shape of Water"" and ""The Favourite""), there was much uncertainty about whether Disney would want much of what the Fox studio does. After all, any future X-Men films could now be made by those in charge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" with Matt Damon and Christian Bale and a lot of sports-cars racing round 1960s Europe, is the kind of expensive, risky original movie Disney's brand-driven mind-set was created specifically to guard against And ""Stuber,"" while different from any movies Disney has and a natural complement to them, may be obsolete for a different reason: R-rated action comedies may simply not be what present-day Disney seeks. For all the talk about combining legendary companies, actually doing it is another matter. In her remarks, Watts said for all the weirdness, she's happy about how things turned out for her and her staff. ""It's clear we've been drafted by the best team in the business,"" she said. That may be true. But it remains to be seen how much playing time they'll get.","<Incident Category>: discrimination in employment, gender inequality

That figure, she noted, is â€?,424 times the median pay of a Disney worker.â€?A growing number of privileged young people, a generation younger than Ms. Disney, are also questioning the morality of their advantages and the social arrangements that produce them.
Many are involved with Resource Generation, an organization for people under 35 who are in the top 10 percent through their own or their familyâ€™s income and wealth.
These â€œclass traitorsâ€?reject the â€œlie of meritocracy,â€?as Yahya Alazrak, a staff member of the organization, called it, adding that they are â€œfundamentally challenging this very core belief that our culture in the United States is built on, that people deserve all of the money that they have,â€?whether it comes from their work or that of their family members.
As a woman in her early 20s told me of the wealth generated by her familyâ€™s global business: â€œItâ€™s not just that I get money without working.
Itâ€™s that other people work to make me money and donâ€™t get nearly as much themselves.
I find it to be morally repugnant.â€?Even those I have talked with whose family wealth was accumulated through less transparently exploitative means, such as tech or finance, or who have high-paying jobs themselves, question what they really deserve.
I will never believe that.â€?She and others challenge the description of wealth garnered through work as â€œearned.â€?In an effort to break the link between money and moral value, they refer to rich people as â€œhigh net wealthâ€?rather than â€œhigh net worth.â€?Immigrants who â€œmake itâ€?are often seen to exemplify the American dream of upward mobility.
This work is critical at a moment when the top 1 percent of families in the United States owns 40 percent of the countryâ€™s wealth, and Jeff Bezos takes home more money per minute than the median American worker makes in a year.
As Holly Fetter, a Resource Generation member and Harvard Business School student, told me, â€œItâ€™s essential that those of us who have access to wealth and want to use it to support progressive social movements speak up, to challenge the narrative that the 1 percent are only interested in accumulation, and invite others to join us.â€?Wealthy people are more likely to convince other wealthy people that the system is unfair.
One person I spoke with, a white 30-year-old who inherited money, said: â€œItâ€™s not that weâ€™re bad people.
Itâ€™s just, nobody needs that much money.â€?But judgments of systems are often taken as judgments of individuals, which leads white people to deny racism and rich people to deny class privilege.
As Ms. Pien put it, â€œOur feelings are related to the bigger structure.â€?One huge cultural support of that structure is secrecy around money, which even rich people donâ€™t talk about.
Yahya Alazrak, of Resource Generation, has heard people say, â€œMy dad wonâ€™t tell me how much money we have because heâ€™s worried that Iâ€™ll become lazy.â€?One man in his early 30s recounted that his parents had always told him they would pay for his education, but not support him afterward until they revealed that he had a trust worth over $10 million.
When wealthy parents do talk about money, they tend to put forth conventional ideas about merit: They or their ancestors worked hard for what they have, scrimped and saved to keep and increase it, and gave some of it away.
When one woman told her immigrant parents she wanted to give their millions away, it was like â€œa slap in the faceâ€?for them, she said, because they felt they had â€œsacrificed a lot for this money.â€?Parents â€?and the financial professionals who manage family wealth â€?also tend to follow conventional wisdom about money: Never give away principal.","This country is rigged in favor of making the very wealthy even wealthier. Thatâ€™s what Democrats keep saying on the 2020 campaign trail. And itâ€™s what some of the people who have reaped the rewards of this rigged system think too. Abigail Disney, granddaughter of Roy Disney, is one recent high-profile example. On Tuesday, she called out the â€œnaked indecencyâ€?of the $65 million in compensation that goes to Disneyâ€™s chief executive, Bob Iger. That figure, she noted, is â€?,424 times the median pay of a Disney worker.â€?A growing number of privileged young people, a generation younger than Ms. Disney, are also questioning the morality of their advantages and the social arrangements that produce them. Many are involved with Resource Generation, an organization for people under 35 who are in the top 10 percent through their own or their familyâ€™s income and wealth. These â€œclass traitorsâ€?reject the â€œlie of meritocracy,â€?as Yahya Alazrak, a staff member of the organization, called it, adding that they are â€œfundamentally challenging this very core belief that our culture in the United States is built on, that people deserve all of the money that they have,â€?whether it comes from their work or that of their family members. Instead, these beneficiaries of the system want to change it. In the past few months, I have talked in depth with 20 young people engaged in this work. They tend to come from families whose parents or ancestors accumulated wealth, and they have inherited or stand to inherit millions. Some have tech or other skills that bring them salaries they feel are disproportionately high. Most are white; some are children of South and East Asian immigrants. They have all studied at prestigious universities. Some are in college or graduate school, while those with jobs work in education, tech, the arts or organizing. Rather than repeat family myths about the individual effort and smarts of their forebears, those from wealthy backgrounds tell â€œmoney storiesâ€?that highlight the more complicated origins of their familiesâ€?assets. If their fortunes came from the direct dispossession of indigenous peoples, enslavement of African-Americans, production of fossil fuels or obvious exploitation of workers, they often express especially acute guilt. As a woman in her early 20s told me of the wealth generated by her familyâ€™s global business: â€œItâ€™s not just that I get money without working. Itâ€™s that other people work to make me money and donâ€™t get nearly as much themselves. I find it to be morally repugnant.â€?Even those I have talked with whose family wealth was accumulated through less transparently exploitative means, such as tech or finance, or who have high-paying jobs themselves, question what they really deserve. They see that their access to such jobs, through elite schools and social networks, comes from their class (and usually race) advantages. They also know that many others work just as hard but reap fewer rewards. One 27-year-old white woman, who stands to inherit several million dollars, told me: â€œMy dad has always been a C.E.O., and it was clear to me that he spent a lot of time at work, but it has never been clear to me that he worked a lot harder than a domestic worker, for example. I will never believe that.â€?She and others challenge the description of wealth garnered through work as â€œearned.â€?In an effort to break the link between money and moral value, they refer to rich people as â€œhigh net wealthâ€?rather than â€œhigh net worth.â€?Immigrants who â€œmake itâ€?are often seen to exemplify the American dream of upward mobility. The children of immigrants I spoke with, though, donâ€™t want their familiesâ€?â€œsuccess storiesâ€?to legitimate an unfair system. Andrea Pien, 32, is a Resource Generation member and a daughter of Taiwanese immigrants who accumulated significant wealth in the United States. She spoke of refusing to be â€œthe token that then affirms the capitalist meritocracy myth, the idea that â€˜Oh, if Andreaâ€™s family made it, we donâ€™t need affirmative action, or we donâ€™t need reparations.â€™â€?In general, these young people donâ€™t believe they are entitled to so much when others have so little. Many describe feeling guilt or shame about their privilege, which often leads them to hide it. One college student, a woman of color, told me that she worried what other campus activists might think of her. â€œWhat a fraud, right?â€?she said. â€œTo be in those spaces and be acting like these are my struggles, when theyâ€™re not.â€?A white woman who lives on her inheritance of more than $15 million spoke of â€œdeflectingâ€?questions about her occupation, so that others would not know she did not do work for pay. These progressive children of privilege told me they study the history of racial capitalism in the United States and discuss the ways traditional philanthropy tends to keep powerful people at the top. They also spend a fair amount of time talking about their money. Should they give it all away? Should they get a job, even if they donâ€™t need the income? How much is it ethical to spend on themselves or others? How does money shape friendships and relationships? Resource Generation and its members facilitate these conversations, including one local chapterâ€™s â€œfeelings caucus.â€?If youâ€™re thinking, â€œCry me a river,â€?youâ€™re not alone. I have faced skepticism from other sociologists when discussing this research. One colleague asserted that rich young people struggling with their privilege do not have a â€œlegitimate problem.â€?Others ask: How much do they really give, and what do they really give up? Arenâ€™t these simply self-absorbed millennials taking another opportunity to talk endlessly about themselves? I understand this view. There is certainly a risk â€?of which many of them are aware â€?that all this conversation will just devolve into navel-gazing, an expression of privilege rather than a challenge to it. It is hard for individual action to make a dent in an ironclad social structure. And it is impossible, as they know, to shed the class privilege rooted in education and family socialization, even if they give away every penny. But like Abigail Disney, these young people are challenging fundamental cultural understandings of who deserves what. And they are breaking the social taboo against talking about money â€?a taboo that allows radical inequality to fade into the background. This work is critical at a moment when the top 1 percent of families in the United States owns 40 percent of the countryâ€™s wealth, and Jeff Bezos takes home more money per minute than the median American worker makes in a year. As Holly Fetter, a Resource Generation member and Harvard Business School student, told me, â€œItâ€™s essential that those of us who have access to wealth and want to use it to support progressive social movements speak up, to challenge the narrative that the 1 percent are only interested in accumulation, and invite others to join us.â€?Wealthy people are more likely to convince other wealthy people that the system is unfair. And they are the only ones who can describe intimately the ways that wealth may be emotionally corrosive, producing fear, shame and isolation. Class privilege is like white privilege, in that its beneficiaries receive advantages that are, in fact, unearned. So for them to conclude that their own wealth is undeserved, and therefore immoral, constitutes a powerful critique of the idea of meritocracy. The fact that the system is immoral, of course, does not make individuals immoral. One person I spoke with, a white 30-year-old who inherited money, said: â€œItâ€™s not that weâ€™re bad people. Itâ€™s just, nobody needs that much money.â€?But judgments of systems are often taken as judgments of individuals, which leads white people to deny racism and rich people to deny class privilege. So even the less-public work of talking through emotions, needs and relationships, which can seem self-indulgent, is meaningful. As Ms. Pien put it, â€œOur feelings are related to the bigger structure.â€?One huge cultural support of that structure is secrecy around money, which even rich people donâ€™t talk about. Wealthy parents fear that if they tell their kids how much they will inherit, the kids wonâ€™t develop a strong work ethic. Yahya Alazrak, of Resource Generation, has heard people say, â€œMy dad wonâ€™t tell me how much money we have because heâ€™s worried that Iâ€™ll become lazy.â€?One man in his early 30s recounted that his parents had always told him they would pay for his education, but not support him afterward until they revealed that he had a trust worth over $10 million. Parents also have a â€œscarcity mentality,â€?Resource Generation members said, which leads them to â€œhoardâ€?assets to protect against calamity. Secrecy also often goes hand in hand with limited financial literacy. Women, especially, may not learn about money management growing up, thanks to gendered ideas about financial planning and male control of family assets. Some people I met who will inherit significant amounts of money didnâ€™t know the difference between a stock and a bond. When wealthy parents do talk about money, they tend to put forth conventional ideas about merit: They or their ancestors worked hard for what they have, scrimped and saved to keep and increase it, and gave some of it away. When their children reject these metrics, parentsâ€?sense of being â€œgood peopleâ€?is challenged. When one woman told her immigrant parents she wanted to give their millions away, it was like â€œa slap in the faceâ€?for them, she said, because they felt they had â€œsacrificed a lot for this money.â€?Parents â€?and the financial professionals who manage family wealth â€?also tend to follow conventional wisdom about money: Never give away principal. Charitable donations should be offset by tax breaks. And the goal of investing is always to make as much money as possible. As one 33-year-old inheritor said, â€œNo financial adviser ever says, â€˜I made less money for the client, but I got them to build affordable housing.â€™â€?Talking about how it feels to be rich can help build affordable housing, though. Once the feeling of being a â€œbad personâ€?is replaced by â€œgood person in a bad structure,â€?these young people move into redistributive action. Many talked about asserting control over their money, pursuing socially responsible investments (sometimes for much lower returns) and increasing their own or their familiesâ€?giving, especially to social-justice organizations. And eventually â€?like the people I have quoted by name here â€?they take a public stand. Finally, they imagine an alternative future, based on a different idea of what people deserve. Ms. Pien, for example, wants to be â€œinvested in collective good, so we can all have the basics that we need and a little more.â€?In her vision, this â€œactually makes everyone more secure and fulfilled and joyful, rather than us hiding behind our mountains of money.â€?Rachel Sherman is a professor of sociology at the New School, an Andrew Carnegie fellow and the author of â€œUneasy Street: The Anxieties of Affluence.â€?The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

With studio slates now dominated by franchises, these executives are moving in the opposite direction, tightening efforts to as little as four or five months for major releases like â€œAquaman,â€?â€œAvengers: Endgameâ€?and the coming â€œCats.â€?â€œWeâ€™re living in an on-demand society where people donâ€™t like to wait,â€?said Michael Moses, Universalâ€™s president of worldwide marketing, citing the rise of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Spotify.
â€œThe long journey you used to be able to take the audience on â€?a teaser to a trailer to TV over a year or longer â€?isnâ€™t as available anymore.â€?Shorter campaigns are becoming â€œthe new normal,â€?he said.
â€œThereâ€™s an entire generation that is very skilled at skipping marketing,â€?Mr. Moses said.
So you are better off waiting until you can really pack a punch.â€?Blair Rich, Warnerâ€™s worldwide marketing chief, said that she started to recalibrate campaign length after analyzing how materials were reverberating online.
â€œIf weâ€™re not re-examining the way that we put movies out to market, how we use our dollars, how we talk to an audience, weâ€™re not doing our jobs.â€?Ms. Rich gave â€œAquamanâ€?a five-month campaign last year, a gutsy move for a movie about a character without the profile of a Batman or Superman.
To compare, â€œSuicide Squad,â€?released by Warner in 2016 to $747 million in ticket sales, had a 13-month campaign.
â€œWhen you start campaigns so far out, you are basically turning a machine on, turning it off and then restarting it again,â€?Ms. Rich said.
â€œWeâ€™re more interested in starting late, having a very high peak right at the start, and then having a very consistent pulse rate, crescendoing at the end.â€?For the year, Warner is second in domestic market share.
â€œThe thinking used to be that you had to keep the fan base constantly excited â€?show a special-effects test two years out,â€?Mr. Ayaz said.
Mr. Moses released the first trailer for â€œTrolls World Tourâ€?in June â€?the animated movie does not arrive until April â€?in part because Universal wants to expand the â€œTrollsâ€?audience beyond primarily young girls.
â€œItâ€™s because Comic-Con forces our hand on the timing of campaigns.â€?She pointed to â€œWonder Woman 1984,â€?which Warner plans to release in June.","LOS ANGELES â€?Conventional wisdom in Hollywood has long held that big, lumbering â€œtentpoleâ€?movies require protracted promotional campaigns. Walt Disney Studios spent more than three years promoting â€œTron: Legacy,â€?which came out in 2010. Warner Bros. began beating the drums for â€œGodzillaâ€?nearly two years before its 2014 release. Universal Pictures first publicized â€œThe Secret Life of Pets 2â€?in August 2016; it arrived last month. But moviedomâ€™s top three marketers, who together control more than $4 billion in annual advertising spending worldwide, say that drawn-out campaigns no longer make sense for most movies. With studio slates now dominated by franchises, these executives are moving in the opposite direction, tightening efforts to as little as four or five months for major releases like â€œAquaman,â€?â€œAvengers: Endgameâ€?and the coming â€œCats.â€?â€œWeâ€™re living in an on-demand society where people donâ€™t like to wait,â€?said Michael Moses, Universalâ€™s president of worldwide marketing, citing the rise of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Spotify. â€œThe long journey you used to be able to take the audience on â€?a teaser to a trailer to TV over a year or longer â€?isnâ€™t as available anymore.â€?Shorter campaigns are becoming â€œthe new normal,â€?he said. His push for â€œCatsâ€?started this week with the release of a provocative trailer that tore across the internet. â€œCats,â€?a big-budget adaptation of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, will arrive in theaters on Dec. 20. Universal is also planning more compact advertising windows for â€œMinions: The Rise of Gruâ€?and â€œFast & Furious 9,â€?both due next year. â€œThereâ€™s an entire generation that is very skilled at skipping marketing,â€?Mr. Moses said. â€œThey donâ€™t see television advertising. They can easily navigate around it in the digital space. But what does grab their attention is new content, especially that first trailer. So you are better off waiting until you can really pack a punch.â€?Blair Rich, Warnerâ€™s worldwide marketing chief, said that she started to recalibrate campaign length after analyzing how materials were reverberating online. â€œWe found we could do much, much better â€?creating a lot less material and more strategically timing the material to connect with our target audience,â€?she said. â€œIf weâ€™re not re-examining the way that we put movies out to market, how we use our dollars, how we talk to an audience, weâ€™re not doing our jobs.â€?Ms. Rich gave â€œAquamanâ€?a five-month campaign last year, a gutsy move for a movie about a character without the profile of a Batman or Superman. The result was striking: $1.1 billion in worldwide ticket sales. To compare, â€œSuicide Squad,â€?released by Warner in 2016 to $747 million in ticket sales, had a 13-month campaign. â€œWhen you start campaigns so far out, you are basically turning a machine on, turning it off and then restarting it again,â€?Ms. Rich said. â€œWeâ€™re more interested in starting late, having a very high peak right at the start, and then having a very consistent pulse rate, crescendoing at the end.â€?For the year, Warner is second in domestic market share. Universal is a whisper behind. The leader is Disney, where Asad Ayaz runs worldwide marketing. â€œThe thinking used to be that you had to keep the fan base constantly excited â€?show a special-effects test two years out,â€?Mr. Ayaz said. â€œWe now think it makes sense to create those moments not that far in advance.â€?Mr. Ayaz cited â€œAvengers: Endgameâ€?as an example of a late-breaking campaign. The promotional onslaught started in December, and the Marvel movie arrived in theaters in late April. â€œEndgameâ€?took in $2.8 billion worldwide. Disney has truncated campaigns for Marvel movies for three reasons. Certain characters â€?Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk â€?already command significant audience awareness. Because Marvel movies have been arriving at a steady clip, one organically promotes the next. Long promotional pushes would also overlap, resulting in fan confusion, Mr. Ayaz said. It is notable that Mr. Ayaz, Ms. Rich and Mr. Moses were each named to their positions last year, amounting to generational change. The new regime â€?under more pressure to control costs than their predecessors â€?is more comfortable with internet analytics and adjusting marketing plans accordingly. With better data tools, â€œweâ€™re really able to find the audience and put materials under its nose,â€?Mr. Moses said. â€œYouâ€™re not doing as much shouting into a hurricane and hoping someone hears you.â€?Shorter does not necessarily mean less. â€œEndgameâ€?may have started late, but the advertising bombardment was aggressive when it did arrive. The biggest Universal movies receive a three-week barrage of â€œsymphonyâ€?marketing support leading up to release from other NBCUniversal divisions, which include cable networks and theme parks. And the marketing chiefs emphasized that one size does not fit all. There will continue to be different timelines for different films. Universal has given â€œFast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shawâ€?a longer campaign, in part because itâ€™s a spinoff and not a sequel. Mr. Moses released the first trailer for â€œTrolls World Tourâ€?in June â€?the animated movie does not arrive until April â€?in part because Universal wants to expand the â€œTrollsâ€?audience beyond primarily young girls. â€œItâ€™s different for different films and different filmmakers,â€?Ms. Rich said. â€œIt may not work every time, and it also may be temporary â€?it could shift again.â€?Adding to the squishiness, studios measure campaign length in different ways. Most consider the first trailer the start; others count teaser posters and early magazine photo spreads as the kickoff. But the trend is pronounced. Look at how studios have changed their approach to Comic-Con International, the annual convention for pop culture enthusiasts that began on Thursday in San Diego. The carnival-like event, which ends on Sunday, was once seen by Hollywoodâ€™s top marketers as a crucial launching pad. Itâ€™s where Disney pushed â€œTron: Legacyâ€?for three years running starting in 2008. This year, Universal, Warner Bros., Sony Pictures and Lionsgate decided not to mount presentations. â€œItâ€™s not because we donâ€™t completely worship the fans,â€?Ms. Rich said. â€œItâ€™s because Comic-Con forces our hand on the timing of campaigns.â€?She pointed to â€œWonder Woman 1984,â€?which Warner plans to release in June. Instead of flying the sequelâ€™s director (Patty Jenkins) and star (Gal Gadot) to Comic-Con to unveil footage, as it most likely would have in the past, Warner had Ms. Jenkins post a teaser image on Twitter. * Netflixâ€™s Movie Blitz Takes Aim at Hollywoodâ€™s Heart * Ann Sarnoff, a Hollywood Outsider, Will Lead Warner Bros.

Disney,DIS,2020/5/10,executive compensation issues,"Disneyâ€™s Head Streaming TikTok C.E.O.
LOS ANGELES â€?The Walt Disney Companyâ€™s top streaming executive, Kevin Mayer, resigned on Monday to become the chief executive of TikTok, the app for making and sharing short videos that has exploded in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr. Mayer, 58, will also serve as chief operating officer of ByteDance, the Chinese conglomerate that owns TikTok.
â€?@tiktok_us previously told me they couldnâ€™t attend hearings and testify because executives were located in #China,â€?Mr. Hawley wrote on Twitter after Mr. Mayerâ€™s hiring was announced.
Vanessa Pappas, a former YouTube executive who joined TikTok as one of its American chiefs last year, said in a November blog post that the companyâ€™s United States-based team would call the shots on TikTokâ€™s U.S. business, including by setting specific rules for American users.
Now Mr. Mayer will provide a clear link between TikTok and ByteDanceâ€™s leadership in Beijing, with his dual roles at the two companies.
(Mr. Iger remains executive chairman, with a focus on the creative process.) Many people in Hollywood and on Wall Street had viewed Mr. Mayer as the logical internal candidate because the future of Disney rests on its ability to transform itself into a streaming titan.
There is no business more important to Disney than streaming, and Mr. Mayer has relished working on services like Disney Plus, which rolled out in November and now has about 55 million subscribers â€?a runaway hit.
Disney also named a new chairman for theme parks and consumer products: Josh Dâ€™Amaro, who was president of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. ByteDance, founded in 2012, has quickly become a major player in the global tech industry with a number of wildly popular apps, including Douyin, in effect the Chinese version of TikTok, and Toutiao, a news aggregator that has run afoul of Chinese regulators for its sometimes racy content.
Mr. Mayer will remain in his current home in Los Angeles, though he will travel frequently to Bytedanceâ€™s headquarters in Beijing, as well as TikTokâ€™s major offices in New York, London, Japan and India, the spokesman said.","Kevin Mayer will lead the Chinese-owned app for making and sharing short videos, which has exploded in popularity during the pandemic. LOS ANGELES â€?The Walt Disney Companyâ€™s top streaming executive, Kevin Mayer, resigned on Monday to become the chief executive of TikTok, the app for making and sharing short videos that has exploded in popularity during the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Mayer, 58, will also serve as chief operating officer of ByteDance, the Chinese conglomerate that owns TikTok. â€œI was happy with my job at Disney,â€?Mr. Mayer said by phone. â€œThe magnitude of this opportunity was just something I couldnâ€™t pass up.â€?He cited gaming and music as two expansion possibilities. (He sounded considerably less eager to post TikToks of himself.) TikTokâ€™s app has been downloaded about 1.9 billion times worldwide, including 172 million downloads in the United States, according to Sensor Tower, an app data firm. And its surging popularity has increased during the pandemic. In the first quarter of this year, it was downloaded 307 million times, more than any other app in the world, according to Sensor Tower data. That popularity has made TikTok by far the biggest digital success for a Chinese-owned company in the Western world. As a result, it has faced deep distrust across the U.S. government. Several government agencies, including nearly all branches of the military, have barred employees from downloading or using the app. In March, Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican from Missouri, proposed legislation to bar any federal employee from using the app. â€?@tiktok_us previously told me they couldnâ€™t attend hearings and testify because executives were located in #China,â€?Mr. Hawley wrote on Twitter after Mr. Mayerâ€™s hiring was announced. â€œBut this new executive lives in the USA. I look forward to hearing from him. Under oath.â€?Both Republicans and Democrats have questioned the Chinese governmentâ€™s influence over the app. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, and Senator Tom Cotton, Republican from Arkansas, co-wrote a letter to the director of national intelligence in October, requesting a review of the national-security implications of TikTokâ€™s expanding influence. TikTok has meanwhile hired a number of American executives and employees to run its business and review content on its app. Vanessa Pappas, a former YouTube executive who joined TikTok as one of its American chiefs last year, said in a November blog post that the companyâ€™s United States-based team would call the shots on TikTokâ€™s U.S. business, including by setting specific rules for American users. Now Mr. Mayer will provide a clear link between TikTok and ByteDanceâ€™s leadership in Beijing, with his dual roles at the two companies. Mr. Mayerâ€™s departure from Disney is not entirely a surprise. Disneyâ€™s board of directors passed over him this year when it was looking for a successor for Robert A. Iger, who abruptly stepped down in February. (Mr. Iger remains executive chairman, with a focus on the creative process.) Many people in Hollywood and on Wall Street had viewed Mr. Mayer as the logical internal candidate because the future of Disney rests on its ability to transform itself into a streaming titan. The top job, however, went to Bob Chapek, the lower-profile chairman of Disneyâ€™s theme parks and consumer products businesses. â€œKevin has had an extraordinary impact on our company over the years,â€?Mr. Chapek said in a statement. â€œHaving worked alongside Kevin for many years on the senior management team, I am enormously grateful to him for his support and friendship.â€?Despite being passed over, Mr. Mayer had indicated that he was in no hurry to leave. There is no business more important to Disney than streaming, and Mr. Mayer has relished working on services like Disney Plus, which rolled out in November and now has about 55 million subscribers â€?a runaway hit. Disney Plus will arrive in parts of Asia and Latin America this year. Hulu, which has about 30 million subscribers, and Hotstar, the leading streaming service in India, have also been part of Mr. Mayerâ€™s portfolio. Mr. Mayer is best known as Disneyâ€™s longtime deals maven. Before running the direct-to-consumer and international division for the past two years, he served as Disneyâ€™s chief strategy officer, helping to orchestrate the purchases of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, most of 21st Century Fox and BamTech, a technology company that specializes in streaming video. Mr. Mayer joined Disney in 1993 before leaving in 2000 to run Playboy.com. He soon returned to Disney to work on Go.com, a web portal that eventually failed, and other Disney websites, including ESPN.com, before moving to strategic planning. Disney named Rebecca Campbell as Mr. Mayerâ€™s successor. She has been ascending quickly. Just last year, she was named president of the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Calif. Before that, Ms. Campbell had a senior leadership role at Disneyâ€™s Europe, Middle East and Africa operation; she worked on the launch plan for Disney Plus. Disney also named a new chairman for theme parks and consumer products: Josh Dâ€™Amaro, who was president of Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. ByteDance, founded in 2012, has quickly become a major player in the global tech industry with a number of wildly popular apps, including Douyin, in effect the Chinese version of TikTok, and Toutiao, a news aggregator that has run afoul of Chinese regulators for its sometimes racy content. Zhang Yiming, 37, its secretive founder and chief executive, has quickly become one of the richest and most influential people in China. While scrutiny of ByteDance increases with its size, his comments have resembled those of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebookâ€™s chief, arguing that ByteDance is a tech company, not a media company. A TikTok spokesman on Monday stressed that TikTok was not owned by a Beijing-based company. Instead, its parent company, ByteDance Ltd., is incorporated in the Cayman Islands, though he could not say how many people are based there. That entity owns TikTok and all of the businesses in China, he said. Mr. Mayer will remain in his current home in Los Angeles, though he will travel frequently to Bytedanceâ€™s headquarters in Beijing, as well as TikTokâ€™s major offices in New York, London, Japan and India, the spokesman said. Brooks Barnes reported from Los Angeles, and Jack Nicas from Oakland, Calif.","<Incident Category>: executive compensation issues

The American biopharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences has issued a nationwide recall of two lots of its coronavirus treatment drug remdesivir because of the ""presence of glass particulates,"" the company said Friday.
""Gilead Sciences Inc. received a customer complaint, confirmed by the firm's investigation, of the presence of glass particulates,"" the company said in a statement.

Remdesivir, known also by its brand name Veklury, is normally used for adults and children over 12 requiring hospitalization for covid-19, and it is normally given by intravenous (IV) infusion once daily for up to 10 days. ""Gilead Sciences Inc. received a customer complaint, confirmed by the firm's investigation, of the presence of glass particulates,"" the company said in a statement. ""An injectable product that contains glass particulates may result in local irritation or swelling in response to the foreign material. If the glass particulate reaches the blood vessels it can travel to various organs and block blood vessels in the heart, lungs or brain which can cause stroke and even lead to death,"" it added. But Gilead noted that to date it has not ""received any reports of adverse events related to this recall."" The California-based company did not immediately respond to a Washington Post request for comment late Friday, but company spokesman Chris Ridley told Bloomberg News the recall involved some 55,000 vials of the drug, enough to treat 11,000 hospitalized patients. The drug is normally ""distributed in single dose clear glass vials in powder form and reconstituted at the site of use,"" the company said. The vials being recalled were distributed nationwide in the United States beginning in October 2021. Remdesivir gained emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in May 2020, with the United States buying up much of its global supply. It was also administered to President Donald Trump when he had covid-19. In October 2020, the antiviral drug became the first treatment for covid-19 to receive full FDA approval. The FDA has outlined its use for adult patients and pediatric patients age 12 and older weighing at least 40 kilograms (88.2 pounds). The FDA has said it should be administered only in a hospital or health-care setting. In its own study last year, Gilead said its drug led to an ""improvement in clinical recovery"" from covid-19 and yielded a 62 percent reduction in risk of death when compared with the outcomes of patients receiving standard medical care. But it said more clinical trials were needed. Amid the spread of the omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, the company said this week that it expected remdesivir to ""continue to be active"" against the new variant and that it would conduct laboratory testing to assess that analysis. Amy Cheng contributed to this report.","<Incident Category>: fraud, violation of national legislation

Shares of the company, which also reported a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, were up nearly 2 percent in midday trading. General Mills, which also owns HÃ¤agen-Dazs and Betty Crocker brands, has been struggling to turn around its U.S. yogurt business as competitors such as Chobani and Danone unleash new flavors and healthier versions of yogurt. Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said he expects new launches, including yogurt with high protein and less sugar, to boost sales in 2019. As the company's yogurt sales continue to fall, General Mills has relied on cereals and snack business to help prop up its top line. For 2019, the company expects total organic net sales to be in the range of flat to up 1 percent in 2019. Including the impact of it acquisition of pet food snacks maker Blue Buffalo, net sales are expected to rise 9 percent to 10 percent from a year earlier. Net earnings attributable to the company fell 13.4 percent to $354.4 million. Excluding certain items, General Mills earned 79 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 72 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales rose 2 percent to $3.89 billion, in line with analysts estimate. Gross margins for the quarter rose to 36.5 percent from 34.7 percent a year earlier. ""We were pleased to see profit margins improve from a year ago as cost savings and increased sales of products with higher profit margins more than offset headwinds from higher transportation and input costs,"" Edward Jones analyst Brittany Weissman said.

Caitlin Long, who works at a tech company in Chicago, said she is buying more Kind bars because their high fruit-and-nut content seems healthier than the milled oats and sugar in Nature Valley and Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bars.
As a result, older brands, including Nature Valley, Special-K and Nutri-Grain, that command the majority of snack-bar sales have lost market share.
General Mills said last month that U.S. retail sales of snack bars dropped 4% in its latest quarter.
Kellogg CEO Steve Cahillane has said the company's Special K bars are associated with low-fat diets that have fallen out of fashion in favor of high-protein and low-carbohydrate eating habits.

Correlation between the <Incident Category> and the <Matched Summary>:

* Climate change: The Nature Valley and Special K bars are losing market share, and Kind bars are gaining popularity due to their high fruit and nut content.

General Motors,GM,2020/12/1,impacts on communities,"Detroit-Hamtramck plant reopens Factory ZERO, itâ€™ll
Factory ZERO, formerly Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly, will be the epicenter for GM's vision for an all-electric future when GM starts making the 2022 GMC Hummer electric pickup there late next year.
The self-driving Cruise Origin car will follow, then several yet-to-be-named EVs. Overseeing the plant's metamorphosis is former assembly line worker, now Factory ZERO's Plant Manager, Jim Quick.

GM said it would permanently shutter it and three other factories in the United States to save money .GM began transferring hundreds of Detroit-Hamtramck's workers to other plants, including Flint Assembly.
Factory ZERO applied lessons GM learned when it partnered with Ventec Life Systems to make ventilators early last spring, Quick said, when GM had to adapt and learn to make the medical devices within days.
But Plater, who started at the plant as an electrician apprentice 18 years ago, said the design of the plant will be worker-friendly, in part because of Quick's own experience as a general assembly line worker in the past.

""Because of the way the plant is imagined, we needed a different support system for the operators,"" said Quick, who will have a different work cadence and do more work on the vehicles than they would on a traditional assembly line.
It is called stop-station assembly and while it has been used in other auto plants in specific areas such as the body shop, very few, if any have used it for general assembly, Quick said.
""More tasks can be done at a single stop-station than during a continuous moving assembly line."" GM has been running simulations of stop-station assembly since May, Quick said.

""Weâ€™re the epicenter for zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion for the company,"" Quick said, referring to the company's vision with electric and self-driving cars.
Quick said GM is changing the way it brings vehicles to market in the future by using simulation, not just in Factory ZERO's operations, but throughout the company.
More: GM to bring 30 new electric vehicles to market in next 5 years ""The result is a leaner, faster General Motors when it comes to launching a vehicle and bringing it to market and weâ€™re at the epicenter of that,"" Quick said.","Less than 5 miles north of General Motors' Detroit Renaissance Center world headquarters sits a vintage 35-year-old factory that less than two years ago was destined for death. But in a reversal of fate, the plant is on the edge of a transformation that will make it GM's most advanced assembly plant in North America. Factory ZERO, formerly Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly, will be the epicenter for GM's vision for an all-electric future when GM starts making the 2022 GMC Hummer electric pickup there late next year. The self-driving Cruise Origin car will follow, then several yet-to-be-named EVs. Overseeing the plant's metamorphosis is former assembly line worker, now Factory ZERO's Plant Manager, Jim Quick.

""We are going to be one of the most technologically advanced plants, not just in our footprint, but across the industry. Weâ€™ll be GMâ€™s first purpose-built, all-electric vehicle assembly plant with contiguous battery assembly as well.â€?Factory ZERO will be full of firsts with technology that will trump that of most U.S. auto plants. For example, it will run on the powerful wireless technology called 5G, which allows robots, machines and computers to talk more smoothly with each other. GM will implement a ""stop-station"" process across general assembly, whereby automated carts bring the vehicle to stations of workers instead of workers standing along a traditional assembly line as the car moves along. The plant will also have simulation software on the floor for on-the-spot training or troubleshooting. And it will make EV batteries in-house. â€œIt definitely will be the factory to be at and the most highly advanced plant in North America, if not the globe,"" said Mike Plater, UAW Local 22 shop chairman. ""Everythingâ€™s going to be brand new and it'll have technology thatâ€™s never been used before. The stop-station assembly â€?Itâ€™s never been done before in general assembly."" Beyond the technology, it was also the plant that set the model for many of GM's factory protocols in operating safely amid the coronavirus pandemic, first implementing face masks, social distancing and contact tracing, for example. 'Moving at ventilator speed' In November 2018, the factory was all but dead. GM said it would permanently shutter it and three other factories in the United States to save money .GM began transferring hundreds of Detroit-Hamtramck's workers to other plants, including Flint Assembly. But D-Ham, as it was called for short, got a reprieve during the 2019 UAW contract talks when GM agreed to retool it to build all-electric vehicles. GM has said it plans to deliver 30 new EVs to market by 2025. So from the minute the final Chevrolet Impala sedan rolled off the assembly line Feb. 27, Quick, Plater and about 90 hourly trades workers got to work tearing apart the plant. GM brought in about 900 construction workers to level the walls, rip off the roof and disembowel the innards of the plant. About a month later, in March, GM would shut down all its factories in North America for eight weeks as the pandemic proliferated. But not Factory ZERO, inwhich GM was investing $2.2 billion to retool before the end of 2021. ""Itâ€™s been a six-day workweek operation because there is so much to do and the time constraints to get it done to build the Hummer on time for launch,"" Plater said. More: Peculiar steel beam marks last days at GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant More: GM's retooling of Detroit-Hamtramck plant continues despite coronavirus So the facility would became GM's model for how to safely run its other plants amid the pandemic. â€œWe were one of the leaders in the company to implement protocols such as masks, physical distancing, hand sanitization, how to deal with cases when they came up, contact tracing â€?because we were here every day,"" Quick said. ""We did all of that with speed and with a lot of collaboration with the UAW here locally."" Decision-making became streamlined. Factory ZERO applied lessons GM learned when it partnered with Ventec Life Systems to make ventilators early last spring, Quick said, when GM had to adapt and learn to make the medical devices within days. That mindset has helped GM move faster to develop EVs, creating a need to add about 3,000 jobs across the company and pull forward some product launches. More: GM leader answered Whitmer's plea in Michigan's hour of need ""We used the term 'moving at ventilator speed,' "" Quick said. ""The thing we learned in taking on the ventilator challenge has transcended in how we run our operations. We want every aspect of our operation to run at ventilator speed.â€?'The roof is back on' At the moment, the plant's general assembly area remains largely bare except for the columns, which were recently painted white, Plater said. The 4.1-million-square-foot plant has grown slightly in height and width, too. ""They raised the roof in the paint shop because the vehicles are taller now, so it had to grow,"" Plater said. ""The body shop had to be put farther out, too."" Construction on the battery shop has not started yet, Plater said. ""The roof is back on and the walls are back up so weâ€™re about a third of the way through the paint shop completion right now, which is where the bulk of the roof and walls were taken down,"" Quick added. GM doesn't have a specific target date for completion other than to say it will start production of the 2022 GMC Hummer pickup there in late 2021. But Plater, who started at the plant as an electrician apprentice 18 years ago, said the design of the plant will be worker-friendly, in part because of Quick's own experience as a general assembly line worker in the past. ""It gives him an understanding of what a person on the plant floor has to go through on the plant floor and thatâ€™s unique versus other plant managers Iâ€™ve dealt with in the past,"" Plater said. ""He understands what it takes to build a vehicle."" Daily calls from past workers GM has recently started to train some employees thanks to one of the first technological advances Factory ZERO has birthed: virtual training. In October, GM called back about 150 employees, both hourly and salary. GM had transferred nearly 600 hourly workers after the plant made the final Impala. Quick calls these 150 people the factory's ""core team."" They started training at GM's preproduction facility at GM's Global Technical Center in Warren. The team uses simulation software that GM developed to practice the hands-on skills needed to assemble the vehicles and work with the machines and tools once they're in the plant. That software will make its way to the factory floor to be used for on-the-spot training once production begins, Quick said. ""So that is a change,"" Quick said. ""This software will be available to the team and leaders on tablets right on the line, at their fingertips, if they need to work through an issue. Thatâ€™s what makes us so unique."" GM will start offering the hourly workers who transferred to other GM plants a chance to return to Factory ZERO in the second and third quarters of next year, he said. GM has said that when the plant is fully operational, it will employ about 2,200 people. But that is probably a year or two out given ramp-up time, Plater said. Still, he gets calls and emails daily from hourly workers who left and want to know when they can return. ""I answer every one of them,"" Plater said. ""I think we'll get the majority back."" Stop-station assembly Factory ZERO will be the first of GM's factories in the world to extensively use the stop-station assembly process in general assembly. ""Because of the way the plant is imagined, we needed a different support system for the operators,"" said Quick, who will have a different work cadence and do more work on the vehicles than they would on a traditional assembly line. What that means is you won't see the typical moving assembly line where a vehicle in its various forms and parts crawls down the line, often on ""skillets,"" which are big pieces of wood that can move up and down. Instead, ""automated guided carts"" will bring the vehicle body and chassis to a station where the workers will do the appropriate work for that part of the assembly process. Then the cart delivers that body and chassis to the next station where employees will perform the next steps in the process. It is called stop-station assembly and while it has been used in other auto plants in specific areas such as the body shop, very few, if any have used it for general assembly, Quick said. ""This provides a very lean and flexible environment to accommodate mix demand or a change to the vehicle. It adds content to the operator, they will need to memorize more and be able to apply more content in their station,"" Quick said. ""More tasks can be done at a single stop-station than during a continuous moving assembly line."" GM has been running simulations of stop-station assembly since May, Quick said. Another advantage of this process is cost. With a traditional moving assembly line, if GM needed to change machinery to make a new model vehicle, that would be costly. Now it can merely tweak the stop-station operator's tools and tasks, Quick said. For workers, this process is easier on their bodies. There will be less walking and less repetition of one single task, thereby lowering the chances of repetitive work injuries, Quick said. It also ensures top quality. ""Itâ€™s having the ability and full control with a stop-station, having 5G and wireless tools, itâ€™s built-in quality in its purest form,"" Quick said. ""Defects do not pass out of the station.â€?Remaking plant culture Factory ZERO is also the first automotive plant in the United States to have 5G connectivity throughout it, Quick said. Mercedes-Benz has used 5G in a plant in southern Germany. The benefit of having 5G is it is fast, reliable and has the bandwidth to allow all the connected devices in the plant to quickly transmit data to each other. Nearly all the robots, tools, machines and computers have an online component, Quick said. But beyond that technology, there is the task of bringing the plant into the 21st century in other ways. Factory ZERO was built in 1985 and has had many monikers over the years. The fact that it was built at all is remarkable. One of its early nicknames was Poletown because GM built it on the site of a Polish immigrant community straddling the Detroit-Hamtramck border. The hulking facility spans the two cities with the body shop sitting in Hamtramck and the general assembly area in Detroit. The Polish neighborhood had been home to about 4,000 residents, more than 1,000 houses, several Catholic churches and about 100 businesses. Government leaders used eminent domain to seize and raze those properties on GMâ€™s behalf. That move made national news and stirred up protests included a nearly monthlong sit-in at the neighborhood's Immaculate Conception Church that police eventually broke up with arrests. So Quick is keenly focused on Factory ZERO's culture, too. ""Part of that is weâ€™re making some physical changes to the plant,"" Quick said. ""We're putting in an open-office concept and itâ€™s going to be a very inviting environment and an environment of inclusion that promotes an engagement among employees that weâ€™ve never seen before.â€?'Coming hard, coming fast' While GM has many technologically advanced plants across the globe, Quick promises none will be like Factory ZERO, calling it the ""flagship battery plant and electric vehicle plant."" ""Weâ€™re the epicenter for zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion for the company,"" Quick said, referring to the company's vision with electric and self-driving cars. Quick said GM is changing the way it brings vehicles to market in the future by using simulation, not just in Factory ZERO's operations, but throughout the company. It is one of the reasons GM CEO Mary Barra cited recently in a presentation to Wall Street for GM's ability to fast-track its EV development and bring the Hummer pickup and Cadillac Lyriq electric SUV to market faster than anticipated.

General Motors,GM,2021/1/21,"impacts on communities, impacts on landscapes","General Motors eliminate gasoline diesel light-duty cars SUVs 2035
General Motors has pledged to stop making gasoline-powered passenger cars, vans and sport utility vehicles by 2035, marking a historic turning point for the iconic American carmaker and promising a future of new electric vehicles for American motorists.
GM chief executive Mary Barra, who antagonized many climate experts by embracing President Donald Trump's relaxation of fuel efficiency targets, said Thursday the company now wants to lead the way to a greener future.
""As one of the world's largest automakers, we hope to set an example of responsible leadership in a world that is faced with climate change,"" Barra said on LinkedIn. GM has said it would invest $27 billion in electric vehicles and associated products between 2020 and 2025, outstripping its spending on conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles.
By late 2025, about 40 percent of the company's U.S. models will be battery-powered electric vehicles, it said.
GM also said it is working with EVgo to triple the scale of the nation's largest public fast-charging network by adding more than 2,700 fast chargers by the end of 2025, a move it says will help speed up electric-vehicle adoption.
Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, which had worked with GM on its plan, called it a ""breakthrough moment."" ""And it's part of a wave of industry action that reinforces what the Biden administration is doing,"" Krupp said.
And GM said that its plans for ""decarbonizing and transitioning to 100 percent EVs"" would take place ""as supported by our commitment to setting science-based targets."" Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that ""given GM's polluting track record, their promise to arrange some offsets for pollution"" suggested that the company's plan was ""just blue smoke and mirrors."" Lawmakers, however, applauded GM's move.
""This is good news for our climate and a smart financial move for the company â€?a win-win."" By pledging to go carbon neutral by 2040, ""GM demonstrates that members of the auto industry are committed to tackling the global climate crisis and decarbonizing the transportation sector,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), who is a former GM executive and also served as president of the General Motors Foundation, said in a statement.
""We have had discussions for months with the auto industry, labor unions, and the environmental community on concrete actions like this that must be taken to reach carbon neutrality."" GM's announcement showed that ""industry does want to work with the administration"" and that ""industry realizes that climate change is real and action on the part of industry is needed,"" Dingell said in an interview.
In her statement, she added, ""Even as we celebrate this announcement, we need to keep our focus on creating jobs, confronting climate change, and the transformation of an innovative mobility industry."" Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in the Clinton White House, said GM is setting the tone for U.S. manufacturing.","General Motors has pledged to stop making gasoline-powered passenger cars, vans and sport utility vehicles by 2035, marking a historic turning point for the iconic American carmaker and promising a future of new electric vehicles for American motorists. GM chief executive Mary Barra, who antagonized many climate experts by embracing President Donald Trump's relaxation of fuel efficiency targets, said Thursday the company now wants to lead the way to a greener future. ""As one of the world's largest automakers, we hope to set an example of responsible leadership in a world that is faced with climate change,"" Barra said on LinkedIn. GM has said it would invest $27 billion in electric vehicles and associated products between 2020 and 2025, outstripping its spending on conventional gasoline and diesel vehicles. That figure includes refurbishing factories and investing in battery production in conjunction with LG Chem, a South Korean battery maker. As part of its plan, GM â€?maker of Buicks, Cadillacs, Chevrolets and Corvettes, among others â€?will manufacture about 30 types of electric vehicles. By late 2025, about 40 percent of the company's U.S. models will be battery-powered electric vehicles, it said. And it pledged to make its factories and other facilities carbon neutral by 2040. One of the Big Three automakers that dominated the North American car market for decades, GM has rolled out millions of pollution-spewing cars and trucks. Transportation accounts for about 28 percent of total U.S. greenhouse-gas emissions, making it the largest contributor of the pollution that is driving climate change. GM now faces the task of reorienting and revamping supply chains, assembly lines and its labor force to produce a new kind of product that few Americans have experienced. ""This is a very significant pivot â€?especially for such an iconic American institution,"" said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan. For a century, GM has been a giant of American carmaking and of the Michigan economy. In Rabe's corner of southeastern Michigan, where tens of thousands of people are employed by the auto industry, ""the central part of life has been the performance of the internal-combustion engine."" ""This is more than just a quick flip of the dial,"" he said. ""It's a very wrenching transition."" It will also be expensive, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the nonprofit Center for Automotive Research. Converting an assembly plant to produce electric cars is a billion dollar or more investment, she said. And pledging to complete that transition by 2035 is ""an aggressive target,"" she said. The electric-vehicle industry has grown exponentially in the past decade but still represents less than 2 percent of automobiles sold in the United States. Global electric-vehicle sales grew in 2020 even while the rest of the car market suffered from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The International Energy Agency projects that the global number of battery-powered and hybrid vehicles could increase from just over 5 million to nearly 140 million by 2030. The timing of the GM announcement was tied in large part to the election of Joe Biden to the White House. On Wednesday, President Biden detailed a far-reaching plan to transition the U.S. economy away from oil, gas and coal and toward solar, wind and other clean energy. The president said he wants the country to lead the global effort to cut the pollution that is driving climate change and speeding the planet toward environmental catastrophe. As part of several actions, Biden signed an executive order that calls for the federal fleet of approximately 645,000 vehicles to be converted to electric power. He has also vowed to expand charging stations for electric cars, revise and extend electric-vehicle tax credits and tighten fuel economy standards for gas-powered vehicles. ""On the heels of the President's historic actions yesterday, we applaud efforts by the private sector to further embrace renewable and clean energy technologies,"" Vedant R. Patel, a White House spokesman, said in an email. ""As the President and many others have said, efforts like this will help grow our economy and create good-paying union jobs."" Other government action has also pushed the auto industry toward electrification. California, the world's fifth-largest economy and the state that created U.S. car culture, will stop sales of gasoline-powered automobiles within 15 years, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced in September. The United Kingdom plans to stop the sales of cars and vans powered by gas and diesel by 2030, five years earlier than planned. ""Major industries have to kind of look to the future and anticipate it,"" Rabe said. ""Do you really want to be the last one standing with the possibility that you're just producing nostalgic vehicles that are being regulated or priced out of existence?"" GM's announcement was seen by others in the automobile industry as a public relations effort to outflank rivals, many of which have already launched aggressive electric-vehicle programs. Volkswagen, for example, is planning to launch almost 70 new electric models in the next 10 years, increase its electric-vehicle production over the next decade to 22 million and pour about $33 billion into electrifying its other vehicles. Ford, which has been building vehicles with internal-combustion engines for more than a century, is spending $11.5 billion through 2022 on new EVs. Tesla plans to increase sales of its all-electric fleet. GM's stock rose nearly 3.5 percent Thursday. The move toward ending tailpipe emissions will affect GM's passenger cars and light-duty trucks â€?SUVs such as the Yukon, as well as vans and minivans and some pickup trucks, such as the Silverado, a company spokeswoman said. But its heavy-duty vehicles â€?box trucks, tractor trailers, utility trucks and some heavy pickup trucks â€?will continue to run on gasoline, the company said. GM also said it is working with EVgo to triple the scale of the nation's largest public fast-charging network by adding more than 2,700 fast chargers by the end of 2025, a move it says will help speed up electric-vehicle adoption. The chargers will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund, which had worked with GM on its plan, called it a ""breakthrough moment."" ""And it's part of a wave of industry action that reinforces what the Biden administration is doing,"" Krupp said. Biden's plan to electrify the federal fleet, from postal trucks to government vans, ""creates demand and drives down costs as privately owned fleets follow suit,"" Krupp said. Some critics said that GM still had not publicly joined four other automakers â€?Ford, Honda, VW and BMW â€?that agreed to comply with California's fuel efficiency standards, which are more stringent than the federal targets under Trump. The California settlement is an important benchmark in restarting negotiations among auto companies, the California Air Resources Board and the Biden administration over cutting greenhouse-gas emissions in the transport sector. For now, GM has still not made as big a commitment as the others through 2026, when fuel economy gets renegotiated again. GM's statement also left some wiggle room in continuing internal-combustion engines, critics noted. The company did not rule out using carbon offsets or credits ""if absolutely necessary"" to reach its goal of eliminating tailpipe emissions. That means GM could invest in programs that remove carbon dioxide from the air, such as tree planting, and still sell some gasoline-powered vehicles. And GM said that its plans for ""decarbonizing and transitioning to 100 percent EVs"" would take place ""as supported by our commitment to setting science-based targets."" Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, said that ""given GM's polluting track record, their promise to arrange some offsets for pollution"" suggested that the company's plan was ""just blue smoke and mirrors."" Lawmakers, however, applauded GM's move. ""General Motors committing to exclusively sell zero-emissions vehicles by 2035 and to be carbon neutral by 2040 is a big deal,"" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said in a statement. ""This is good news for our climate and a smart financial move for the company â€?a win-win."" By pledging to go carbon neutral by 2040, ""GM demonstrates that members of the auto industry are committed to tackling the global climate crisis and decarbonizing the transportation sector,"" Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), who is a former GM executive and also served as president of the General Motors Foundation, said in a statement. ""We have had discussions for months with the auto industry, labor unions, and the environmental community on concrete actions like this that must be taken to reach carbon neutrality."" GM's announcement showed that ""industry does want to work with the administration"" and that ""industry realizes that climate change is real and action on the part of industry is needed,"" Dingell said in an interview. In her statement, she added, ""Even as we celebrate this announcement, we need to keep our focus on creating jobs, confronting climate change, and the transformation of an innovative mobility industry."" Paul Bledsoe, a former climate adviser in the Clinton White House, said GM is setting the tone for U.S. manufacturing. ""When America's most iconic manufacturer commits to carbon neutrality, that's a huge signal to the rest of the economy,"" said Bledsoe, who is now at the Progressive Policy Institute. ""At the same time, it's clear GM is trying to burnish its reputation from past practices and justify new tax incentives."" And now, GM will have to persuade American consumers to change a century-old habit. ""It will be incumbent on these auto manufacturers to really sell the transition,"" Rabe said, ""not just with glitzy advertising and sales pitches but delivering on quality of the driving and of the experience.""

Despite the bill and Biden's outspoken support for unions, Tesla's stock has been doing better than ever.","A Change.org petition has received more than 40,000 signatures as of early Wednesday demanding that President Joe Biden acknowledge Tesla's leadership in the electric vehicle market. The petition claims that Tesla was repeatedly left out of conversations by the Biden administration in favor of other automakers like General Motors. More specifically, it points to August 2021, when Biden signed an executive order setting a target for zero-emissions vehicles to account for half of all automobiles sold in the USA by 2030. Tesla, the U.S. leader in electric vehicle sales, was not among the auto companies represented at the White House. Company CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter that it â€œseems oddâ€?Tesla wasnâ€™t invited. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the companies that were invited are the three largest employers of United Auto Workers members: General Motors, Ford and Chrysler. Tesla workers are not part of a union. â€œIâ€™ll let you draw your own conclusion,â€?Psaki said. 'No turning back:' Biden signs order targeting half of all vehicles sold in US to be zero-emissions by 2030 The petition also raises the fact that Musk was not invited to the White House last week for a meeting with top CEOs about passing his Build Back Better spending plan. The meeting's roster included heavyweights like General Motors CEO Mary Barra and Ford CEO Jim Farley, according to The Hill. ""The recent event at the White House was for business leaders that support BBB to talk about how it is good for the economy. And last summerâ€™s event at the White House was for U.S. automakers like Ford, GM and Stellantis who were transitioning and expanding into the EV market,"" says Vedant Patel, White House assistant press secretary. Patel says that Tesla has done ""extraordinary things for electric vehicles"" but that its CEO has suggested he opposes new EV tax credits. Musk has indeed been an outspoken opponent of Biden's Build Back Better legislation. In a Wall Street Journal summit in December, Musk said, ""It might be better if the bill doesnâ€™t pass."" Tesla stands to lose its competitive edge if a measure of the bill passes, which grants a $12,500 tax credit to anyone who purchases an electric vehicle from manufacturers with a unionized workforce. ""President Biden is focused on creating good union jobs across the country and believes firmly that every worker in every state must have a free and fair choice to join a union and the right to bargain collectively with their employer,"" Patel told USA TODAY. In a Labor Day speech in the East Room, Biden said: ""When unions win, workers across the board win. Thatâ€™s a fact. Families win, community wins, America wins. We grow. And despite this, workers have been getting cut out of the deal for too long a time."" Despite the bill and Biden's outspoken support for unions, Tesla's stock has been doing better than ever. Tesla's most recent earnings report last week showed record growth in profitability and vehicle production and output, despite the volatility of 2021. The company managed to increase production of cars to 305,840 in Q4 2021, showing 83% growth compared with the same period last year, according to its earnings reports. On top of that, Tesla managed to nearly double profits from its automotive business, from about $7 billion to nearly $14 billion in 2021. General Motors, which held its Q4 2021 earnings on Tuesday, reported that it sold 1,477,000 vehicles globally for the quarter, according to its earnings deck. While General Motors still sells more cars than Tesla, Tesla's market cap, which indicates the value of its shares, surpasses $1 trillion. Part of it is as a result of Tesla's valuation as a tech company with innovative software, which offers it strong projected growth and flexibility amid a pandemic. Tesla's record numbers: Tesla delivers a record number of cars as other manufacturers struggle amid chip shortage When many major automakers had to temporarily close plants because they couldn't get enough of the specific semiconductors their cars need, Tesla's engineers wrote new firmware that allowed them to sub in alternative chips and thus source more from suppliers.

The company has a contract ""to develop a fully integrated U.S. supply chain for rare-earth magnets"" with General Motors (GM). A leg up from the Biden administration earlier this year initially benefited the electrical-vehicle supply chain. MP Materials went public in late 2020 by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, and we found that despite the 2022 slump, the shares have provided a hefty return to early investors through May.

He now owns 146,901 MP Materials shares. A former chief financial officer of Omnicom Group (OMC), Weisenburger joined MP Materials' board in 2020. Weisenburger declined to comment on his stock purchase.

Goldman Sachs,GS,2022/6/8,poor employment conditions,"Rush E.S.G., Elon Musk
Mr. Musk trashed E.S.G. investing.
The current gut check comes at a point in the evolution of the investing industry when assets in so-called E.S.G. funds have risen 38 percent in the past year, to $2.7 trillion by the end of March, according to Morningstar Direct.
That can lead to episodes like one last month when Elon Musk called the entire industry a â€œscam,â€?after S&P Global had the temerity to remove Tesla from an E.S.G. index.
Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission is frantically trying to catch up, investigating Goldman Sachs and other big banks and questioning whether some are slapping E.S.G. labels on funds that may not deserve them to make a grab for investor assets.
To try to help everyday investors make sense of this, I turned to two professionals who have spent a fair bit of time vetting wannabe E.S.G. investments.
The first is Amy Domini, 72, the founder and chair of Domini Impact Investments and a pioneer in the E.S.G. field.
RON LIEBER: Whatâ€™s the most accurate definition of E.S.G. today, and how has it changed?
I view it as providing a more robust set of material data points from which an investment adviser can make a decision.
RACHEL ROBASCIOTTI: We call our work â€œsocial justice investing.â€?Itâ€™s the deep integration of four areas: racial, gender, economic and climate justice.
LIEBER: Academics have been talking for years about how so-called active investing is a bad idea â€?that itâ€™s just too hard to actively select the stocks that will do better than others over the long haul.
Doesnâ€™t E.S.G. investing violate these principles?
ROBASCIOTTI: In order to do a good job of social justice investing, you have to be active on those issues and pay attention when a companyâ€™s behavior shifts in a way that has a real, material impact on its future.
LIEBER: Maybe itâ€™s better for curious investors to play with the word â€œactiveâ€?then, and think of E.S.G. as activist investing.
If someone is going to pay the higher-than-average fees â€?or at least the higher-than-basic-index-funds fees that firms like yours charge â€?it shouldnâ€™t just be to move money around silently from one public company to another in a way that may not have much impact.
LIEBER: Elon Musk would beg to differ on the value that E.S.G. adds.
ROBASCIOTTI (chuckling): Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™d say: The reason that youâ€™re confused is because youâ€™re a single-issue C.E.O., and thatâ€™s not the way of the future.
LIEBER: Individual investors face scores of E.S.G. choices.
If weâ€™re going to have a different world â€?if we are going to invest in making more of what we actually want â€?weâ€™re going to have to choose a different set of people who havenâ€™t yet been at the table.","Mr. Musk trashed E.S.G. investing. The S.E.C. is investigating Goldman Sachsâ€™s move into the sector. In a falling market, what should investors consider? Any time the stock market falls, investors are likely to rethink nearly everything. The current gut check comes at a point in the evolution of the investing industry when assets in so-called E.S.G. funds have risen 38 percent in the past year, to $2.7 trillion by the end of March, according to Morningstar Direct. Professionals overlay all manner of rules and screens for the investments they pick, using climate, diversity or other data to construct what are now over 6,000 funds worldwide. There is a cost for consciousness: The funds often have high fees that can reduce returns if the investments donâ€™t do better than whatever alternatives you reject. And thereâ€™s a fair bit of confusion about what the term E.S.G. â€?short for environmental, social and governance â€?means in practice. That can lead to episodes like one last month when Elon Musk called the entire industry a â€œscam,â€?after S&P Global had the temerity to remove Tesla from an E.S.G. index. S&P did this, it said, in part because of accusations of racial discrimination and other worker mistreatment. Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission is frantically trying to catch up, investigating Goldman Sachs and other big banks and questioning whether some are slapping E.S.G. labels on funds that may not deserve them to make a grab for investor assets. To try to help everyday investors make sense of this, I turned to two professionals who have spent a fair bit of time vetting wannabe E.S.G. investments. The first is Amy Domini, 72, the founder and chair of Domini Impact Investments and a pioneer in the E.S.G. field. The second is Rachel Robasciotti, 43, the founder and chief executive of Adasina Social Capital, which describes itself as an â€œinvestment and financial activismâ€?firm. Hereâ€™s what they had to say. RON LIEBER: Whatâ€™s the most accurate definition of E.S.G. today, and how has it changed? AMY DOMINI: Before we start, is that the preferred vocabulary? When I got started it was â€œethical investing,â€?but Iâ€™ve lost so many vocabulary fights in my life. I view it as providing a more robust set of material data points from which an investment adviser can make a decision. And I view it as fulfillment of a fiduciary obligation. Assets arenâ€™t being managed to the greatest interest of beneficiaries if, in fact, they canâ€™t breathe or life is too dangerous at the end of their wealth building. So I see it as a means to an end, and that end is a planet that is livable â€?and lives worth living. And I see it as a strategy that explicitly acknowledges that investorshave a role to play in providing these outcomes to the world. LIEBER: Rachel, you were familiar with Amyâ€™s funds. Did you come to a different conclusion? RACHEL ROBASCIOTTI: We call our work â€œsocial justice investing.â€?Itâ€™s the deep integration of four areas: racial, gender, economic and climate justice. LIEBER: Defining justice seems messy these days. On one hand, some investors donâ€™t want to invest in weapons manufacturers. On the other, many of them would very much like to put more weapons in the hands of the Ukrainians. ROBASCIOTTI: In the world our investors want to live in, the government is responsible for weapons and defense, and that is not a private activity. LIEBER: Wait, so the government should be producing weapons? DOMINI: Capitalism is great at distributing goods and services broadly and cheaply. Weapons shouldnâ€™t be distributed broadly and cheaply. LIEBER: Academics have been talking for years about how so-called active investing is a bad idea â€?that itâ€™s just too hard to actively select the stocks that will do better than others over the long haul. Doesnâ€™t E.S.G. investing violate these principles? ROBASCIOTTI: In order to do a good job of social justice investing, you have to be active on those issues and pay attention when a companyâ€™s behavior shifts in a way that has a real, material impact on its future. DOMINI: Take Square. They had an arguably strong story for empowering small-business owners, a strong economic justice theme that you could get excited about. As they became more and more of a blockchain company â€?to the point where they changed their name, that initial exciting thesis became less and less present. LIEBER: Maybe itâ€™s better for curious investors to play with the word â€œactiveâ€?then, and think of E.S.G. as activist investing. If someone is going to pay the higher-than-average fees â€?or at least the higher-than-basic-index-funds fees that firms like yours charge â€?it shouldnâ€™t just be to move money around silently from one public company to another in a way that may not have much impact. Activists bring pressure. They make noise. DOMINI: We wrote 150 companies in Japan, pointing out that there were two genders and their boards didnâ€™t reflect that fact. Japan doesnâ€™t have robust shareholder resolution opportunities, but that doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t have some activism. LIEBER: Weâ€™re in a bear market now. Thatâ€™s often a time when people look to cut costs in their investment portfolios. Thereâ€™s a long history of hand-wringing in the investment industry about the fact that your funds are not cheap. Do you lose in these kinds of market conditions? DOMINI: You have E.S.G. products now at Vanguard, Fidelity, TIAA. Theyâ€™re all doing it because it adds value to the investment decision-making process. That doesnâ€™t go away. Itâ€™s here to stay. ROBASCIOTTI: Historically, women, people of color â€?particularly Black people like myself â€?werenâ€™t allowed into the industry. And now that weâ€™re starting to emerge, weâ€™re in a situation where we have this enormous price pressure. â€œBring your fees down!â€?Organizing, mobilizing, educating other investors, putting together data sets â€?all of that takes people. You have to be able to invest in them. So I would really question if someone is delivering impact at a really low price point. Many, many, many times with cheap E.S.G., you could hit a data wall and stop. And what weâ€™ve done is break down the data wall. LIEBER: OK, but do you always trust the data that you get from companies themselves â€?the raw numbers or the way they might be selectively counting things? ROBASCIOTTI: We use less of the data that companies provide on their own. Data gathered independently by third parties who are verifying it with public companiesâ€?practices is what we really lean on. LIEBER: Elon Musk would beg to differ on the value that E.S.G. adds. How would you try to persuade him in 100 words or less? ROBASCIOTTI (chuckling): Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™d say: The reason that youâ€™re confused is because youâ€™re a single-issue C.E.O., and thatâ€™s not the way of the future. The way of the future is people and planet, and a fractured society canâ€™t make anything, including electric cars. DOMINI: He went after my industry instead of going after the index that excluded him. The whole industry didnâ€™t throw him out. LIEBER: Individual investors face scores of E.S.G. choices. Goldman Sachs and others hope that familiar names will matter. Whatâ€™s the correct framing question that individuals should ask when fund shopping? ROBASCIOTTI: Thereâ€™s actually three. The first is, what are your issues? To us, those are racial, gender, economic and climate, because those are the places where capitalism extracts value unsustainably. Then, how are you measuring it? And the most important question, beyond a shadow of a doubt, is who decides what matters? Go to the people who are most impacted and ask them what is significant, because theyâ€™re closest to the problem and often farthest from the power. And thatâ€™s information that investors are not currently getting. LIEBER: Whatâ€™s the most nonobvious example of this third one? ROBASCIOTTI: When we went to the Poor Peopleâ€™s Campaign and asked what we should be focusing on, they led us to working with One Fair Wage, which is working to eliminate subminimum wages for tip workers. We created a whole â€œInvestors for Livable Wagesâ€?campaign and had a collective investor statement that represented over half a trillion dollars of investor money, via the signers, making the case for all public companies ending subminimum wages. LIEBER: This all feels like a lot of work for the investor. Whereâ€™s my interactive tool that allows just one of the many funds to fall out as my best choice? DOMINI: I feel that a step is better than not taking a step. Iâ€™m not totally hung up on who does a better analysis, or an analysis that is consistent with my own analysis. Iâ€™ve looked at so-called strict portfolios that have stocks that I wouldnâ€™t put in my portfolio. LIEBER: So this analysis paralysis is my problem â€?this isnâ€™t the industryâ€™s problem? DOMINI: I like women-owned firms, if you want to start with something! ROBASCIOTTI: Just 1.4 percent of all assets at U.S.-based firms are managed by firms owned by women or people of color. So you can narrow your universe right there. The reason why that matters is that doing it the way weâ€™ve always done it has given us the world we have now. If weâ€™re going to have a different world â€?if we are going to invest in making more of what we actually want â€?weâ€™re going to have to choose a different set of people who havenâ€™t yet been at the table.","<Incident Category>: poor employment conditions

If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Download Insider's app here. Click here. 1. High turnover, tensions between executives, and mounting losses at Goldman Sachs' Marcus have stifled the bank's efforts to encroach on Main Street. It's fast becoming a defining moment for Chief Executive David Solomon. Executives had grand plans for Marcus â€?an online bank, named after founder Marcus Goldman, that offers high-yield savings accounts. Marcus was set up as a standalone entity with a popcorn machine and denim-wearing employees â€?a nod to the informal startup culture evident in places like Silicon Valley. Despite the forward-thinking initiative, Solomon has grown increasingly frustrated as Goldman's share price did not seemingly reflect the promise of building a digital, consumer bank. Analysts have also argued that management teams â€?who are sometimes too close to a project â€?grow enamored by its potential without seeing the same risks that investors might. And when you have the bank account of Goldman Sachs, it's easy to continually throw money at a loss-making exercise, compared to a startup that needs to source third-party capital. Now, five years since it launched, Marcus is burning cash with little sign of a profit. Executives expect it to lose another $1.2 billion this year. The ballooning expenses have frustrated Goldman's No. 2, President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron, who now holds regular meetings with Marcus leadership to discuss how to get costs down. For the full story, check out this feature from Insider's Chief Finance Correspondent Dakin Campbell.

Elon Musk sold 7.92 million Tesla shares worth almost $6.9 billion. Musk said he could need the funds if he loses the legal battle with Twitter and is forced to buy the social media platform for $44 billion. Musk, who is now left with a 15% stake in the electric car maker, explained his action in a late tweet Tuesday. 4. OlympusDAO once paid 7,000% interest on its token, but now it's being sued by a backer. A 22-year-old business major from Weston, Connecticut, is behind one of crypto's most notorious projects, according to a lawsuit seeking $791 million. 5. Titan, the investing startup backed by Kevin Durant and Will Smith, is looking to buy another fintech. Joe Percoco, the firm's co-chief executive, details how struggling startups will be looking for an exit in the coming months, and he talked about Titan's plans for more hiring. 6. Citi is hiring a decentralized finance and stablecoin risk manager as part of its push into crypto. The US bank also plans to hire up to 100 folks to build out a digital assets division that will sit within Citi's institutional client group, The Block reported. 7. Europe's bond market is enduring its worst drought in dealmaking for at least eight years, according to Bloomberg.

On the other hand, the investment manager more than tripled holdings in Corning (GLW) and Halliburton (HAL), and also bought more shares of drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA).
Crossmark did likewise to its stake in the company in the fourth quarter, ending the year with 224,400 shares.
Crossmark sold 78,400 shares in the fourth quarter to end the year with 186,000 DowDuPont shares.
Crossmark scooped up 210,100 more additional Corning shares in the last quarter of the year, and ended 2017 with 301,400 shares.

Crossmark bought 34,200 more shares of Walgreens in the fourth quarter, raising its investment to 193,300 shares.","Houston-based Crossmark Global Investments goes one further on the typical progressive advisor who only screens investments for environmental, social and governance (ESG) parameters. Crossmark also offers screens for faith, including Baptists, Catholic and Methodist parameters. It appears that Crossmark, which manages more than $4.1 billion in U.S.-traded equities, has lately lost faith in some stocks. It has slashed the investment in General Electric (ticker: GE) in half and sold a third of its position in DowDuPont (DWDP). On the other hand, the investment manager more than tripled holdings in Corning (GLW) and Halliburton (HAL), and also bought more shares of drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA). GE shares were cut in half in 2017 . Crossmark did likewise to its stake in the company in the fourth quarter, ending the year with 224,400 shares. Maybe it should have sold the entire stake. Shares have crumbled 15% so far in 2018 through Monday's close. The company has had its share of woes in January . Interestingly, a unit of DowDuPont cleared its portfolio of GE stock  in the fourth quarter. DowDuPont in partial contrast to GE had quite a good 2017, rising 28%, excluding dividends, topping the 20% rise in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Alas, DowDuPont, too, is sliding in 2018, with shares down nearly 5%. The company earlier this month raised the estimate for cost savings for its upcoming breakup . Crossmark sold 78,400 shares in the fourth quarter to end the year with 186,000 DowDuPont shares. Corning shares surged 35% in 2017 on favorable market trends including a $200 million investment  from Apple (AAPL), and accelerated buybacks . This year has taken a few swipes at the supplier of mobile-phone glass: Corning is down 7% on news of subdued iPhone sales . We remain upbeat on Corning , however, as we like its additional opportunities in phones, optical fiber and automotive. An analyst we spoke with says Corning shares are worth $37 each, up 24% from Monday's close. Crossmark scooped up 210,100 more additional Corning shares in the last quarter of the year, and ended 2017 with 301,400 shares. Halliburton shares are up 2.4% so far in 2018, after 2017's 8% slump. A strong fourth-quarter report and an analyst upgrade  helped lift the stock of the oilfield-services firm. Crossmark bought 166,500 more shares of Halliburton in the fourth quarter, raising its investment to 240,200 shares. Crossmark bought 34,200 more shares of Walgreens in the fourth quarter, raising its investment to 193,300 shares. The retailer saw shares slide 11% in 2017 after an outright merger with Rite Aid (RAD) was scrubbed , and investors remained caution about potential encroachment from Amazon.com (AMZN). Shares are down 3% in 2018 so far as pharmacy spending could come under pressure as a new alliance to cut medical costs emerges . Crossmark itself has seen a renewal. The name is new, adopted last year to replace ""Capstone Financial Services."" President and Chief Executive Michael Kern is also fairly recent, having joined 2015. ""The asset management industry is becoming increasingly competitive,"" Crossmark noted in a press release announcing the name change . ""In order to not only survive but to also thrive, firms must have a clearly defined value proposition."" If big bets including Corning and Halliburton pay off, the superior performance will certainly get across to Crossmark's clients. Follow @BarronsEdLin  Comments?

Home Depot (The),HD,2021/8/17,"discrimination in employment, violation of national legislation","Shoplifting syndicates costing retailers billions year. Industry insiders pointing ease online reselling helping crime rings thrive.
They are stealing specific items that they know they can resell online."" Brewer said that organized retail crime rings vary in terms of their size, origin, and specialty.
""They'll steal up to that amount and they'll go to the next door and they'll steal up to that amount."" 'It really hits retailers from multiple directions' Brewer and Glenn said the proliferation of e-commerce has also led to a boom in criminals fencing stolen goods online.
Glenn said that not all online sales platforms ""have the same level of control and vetting"" when it comes to merchants, while Brewer said that no online platform is currently doing enough to combat crime.
Brewer also said that online platforms need to do away with anonymity for sellers in order to combat organized retail crime.
The Buy Safe Coalition is backing the INFORM Consumers Act, a bill that would force online platforms to authenticate ""high-volume third-party sellers."" ""If the marketplaces have to start verifying the people selling on their platform and providing that information to the public, it's going to be a lot harder for people to sell stolen goods,"" Brewer said.
""We believe collaboration and cooperation between law enforcement, retailers and marketplaces is the best way to combat fraud and organized retail crime."" An Amazon spokesperson told Insider that the company in 2020 invested $700 million and a workforce of 10,000 to ""prevent fraud and abuse in our store."" ""Amazon does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods in our store, and we work closely with law enforcement, retailers, and brands to stop bad actors and hold them accountable, including withholding funds, terminating accounts, and making law enforcement referrals,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Insider.
The Makers and Merchants Coalition, a trade group that represents third-party online sellers, has come out against the INFORM Act. It argues that there ""is no need to require private citizens to disclose their personal information to the public to sell a small number of products online."" ""The true mission of the INFORM Act is to eliminate big-box retail's competition by hurting small sellers,"" spokesperson Katie Wright said in a statement sent to Insider.
""The Act does nothing to stop stolen goods at their main source, brick and mortar retail stores, but does threaten to compromise the safety and personal information of small online sellers who use larger marketplaces to sell their products."" Wright said that online marketplaces already ""collect personal information from sellers as one of the many measures taken to prevent the sale of millions of stolen and counterfeit products every year."" But Glenn and Brewer stressed the threat that organized retail crime posed.
""Not only is the retailer having the merchandise stolen from them, but then somebody is competing with them online by selling the same product for half the price because it's stolen,"" he said.","Summary List Placement Among well-lit rows of drills, lawn care equipment, and power washers, all still carefully packaged, a small American flag hangs over a shelf of Milwaukee Tools, a Home Depot-exclusive brand. Without context, it looks like it could have been any Home Depot warehouse. But this video footage, viewed by Insider, doesn't depict a fulfillment center, or even the stock room of a Home Depot store. It captures a secret California warehouse stocked with goods stolen from the home improvement giant. It was shot by one of Home Depot's own organized retail crime investigators in 2020, as police served a search warrant on the storage facility. All in all, the warehouse contained millions of dollars in stolen products. That's just one snapshot of a crime wave that's been building for years. Back in 2011, the FBI posited that ""organized retail crime"" was a $30 billion industry. And industry operators say the problem has only grown since then. A 2020 survey from the National Retail Federation found that organized retail theft has seen a nearly 60% increase from 2015, now averaging $719,548 for every $1 billion in sales. Retailers are now sounding the alarm on spiking theft statistics and the role of e-commerce platforms as ""fences."" Traditionally, fences have taken the form of pawn shops or flea markets, but the rise of online shopping has turned this on its head. Brick-and-mortar retailers complaining that thieves are increasingly hawking pilfered products online, but e-commerce platforms argue that regulating sites will just stifle competition. Retail companies have implemented a number of initiatives to combat these targeted thefts. Recently, Home Depot released power tools that won't work unless they're properly scanned and activated at the register via Bluetooth technology. The retailer is also looking to continue to introduce technology to combat theft, rather than locking up products. Stores have experimented with lockable cart wheels that freeze up if a person shoves a cartload of goods outside without paying. Others resort to controversial facial recognition tools, often in addition to other security measures, to assist in identifying thieves. Critics say that, without regulation, this technology could end up violating human rights. Jason Brewer, the spokesperson for the Buy Safe America Coalition, a lobby group for the retail industry, spoke with Insider about the efficient, intricate shadow businesses of professional shoplifters. ""This is a professional criminal,"" Brewer said. ""They're not looking to steal food for dinner, or something they need because they can't afford it. They are stealing specific items that they know they can resell online."" Brewer said that organized retail crime rings vary in terms of their size, origin, and specialty. He said that some could be connected to larger organized crime outfits. For those major players, organized retail crime is yet another business in a portfolio that may also include narcotics sales, human trafficking, and gunrunning. Smaller rings could just be a group led by a figure that can convince desperate people â€?sometimes impoverished, unhoused, and drug-dependent persons â€?to steal in exchange for a small cut of money. Shoplifting ring ""CEOs"" will pass down a product list to low-level members, who then must go out and steal those items in order to get paid. ""The leaders don't really care what happens to the runners,"" Scott Glenn, Home Depot's vice president of asset protection, told Insider. ""They're just paying them a hundred bucks a day, but the runners will bring back thousands of dollars worth of product that then gets resold for profit."" But despite their ubiquity, Glenn said it is important not to underestimate shoplifting groups. He said that they can be helmed by ""good administrators"" and function somewhat akin to shadow businesses. Glenn said that in some cases, these professional shoplifters will steal ""right up to that felony threshold"" without ever crossing the line. Most states have a felony theft threshold, meaning that a person who steals money or property valued over a certain amount can be charged with felony, rather than misdemeanor, theft. The NRF notes that these syndicates often look for ""a mix of valuable high-end products and cheap but easier to fence everyday necessities."" ""They know that nothing's going to happen if it doesn't pass that certain level,"" Glenn said. ""They'll steal up to that amount and they'll go to the next door and they'll steal up to that amount."" 'It really hits retailers from multiple directions' Brewer and Glenn said the proliferation of e-commerce has also led to a boom in criminals fencing stolen goods online. Glenn said that not all online sales platforms ""have the same level of control and vetting"" when it comes to merchants, while Brewer said that no online platform is currently doing enough to combat crime. And all this means that retailers feel they are battling exponential growth in organized theft that everyday shoppers are likely not aware of. In the 2020 NRF survey, 59% of respondents said they'd spotted stolen merchandise from their company being sold on websites â€?that's up 9% from 2018. Brewer also said that online platforms need to do away with anonymity for sellers in order to combat organized retail crime. The Buy Safe Coalition is backing the INFORM Consumers Act, a bill that would force online platforms to authenticate ""high-volume third-party sellers."" ""If the marketplaces have to start verifying the people selling on their platform and providing that information to the public, it's going to be a lot harder for people to sell stolen goods,"" Brewer said. Online platforms have pushed back against the idea that they're allowing thieves to run rampant on their sites. eBay has touted its efforts to remove suspicious listings, as well as its initiatives to protect copyright and trademark owners, community members dealing with unsafe goods, and third-party brands. ""eBay is fully committed to providing a safe and secure online shopping experience to millions of people globally and we have zero tolerance for criminal activity on our platform,"" an eBay spokesperson told Insider. ""We believe collaboration and cooperation between law enforcement, retailers and marketplaces is the best way to combat fraud and organized retail crime."" An Amazon spokesperson told Insider that the company in 2020 invested $700 million and a workforce of 10,000 to ""prevent fraud and abuse in our store."" ""Amazon does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods in our store, and we work closely with law enforcement, retailers, and brands to stop bad actors and hold them accountable, including withholding funds, terminating accounts, and making law enforcement referrals,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Insider.

Wright said that online marketplaces already ""collect personal information from sellers as one of the many measures taken to prevent the sale of millions of stolen and counterfeit products every year."" But Glenn and Brewer stressed the threat that organized retail crime posed. Both said that, when desperate, professional shoplifters could pose a physical threat to shoppers and retail employees. Glenn said if left unchecked, mass theft could push higher prices onto consumers, while Brewer said that smaller stores could shutter. ""Not only is the retailer having the merchandise stolen from them, but then somebody is competing with them online by selling the same product for half the price because it's stolen,"" he said.

The Buy Safe Coalition is backing the INFORM Consumers Act, a bill that would force online platforms to authenticate ""high-volume third-party sellers."" ""If the marketplaces have to start verifying the people selling on their platform and providing that information to the public, it's going to be a lot harder for people to sell stolen goods,"" Brewer said.
""We believe collaboration and cooperation between law enforcement, retailers and marketplaces is the best way to combat fraud and organized retail crime."" An Amazon spokesperson told Insider that the company in 2020 invested $700 million and a workforce of 10,000 to ""prevent fraud and abuse in our store."" ""Amazon does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods in our store, and we work closely with law enforcement, retailers, and brands to stop bad actors and hold them accountable, including withholding funds, terminating accounts, and making law enforcement referrals,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Insider.
The Makers and Merchants Coalition, a trade group that represents third-party online sellers, has come out against the INFORM Act. It argues that there ""is no need to require private citizens to disclose their personal information to the public to sell a small number of products online."" ""The true mission of the INFORM Act is to eliminate big-box retail's competition by hurting small sellers,"" spokesperson Katie Wright said in a statement sent to Insider.
""The Act does nothing to stop stolen goods at their main source, brick and mortar retail stores, but does threaten to compromise the safety and personal information of small online sellers who use larger marketplaces to sell their products."" Wright said that online marketplaces already ""collect personal information from sellers as one of the many measures taken to prevent the sale of millions of stolen and counterfeit products every year."" But Glenn and Brewer stressed the threat that organized retail crime posed.
""Not only is the retailer having the merchandise stolen from them, but then somebody is competing with them online by selling the same product for half the price because it's stolen,"" he said.

In this case, the incident category is discrimination in employment and violation of national legislation. The matched summary addresses these categories by discussing organized retail crime rings stealing specific items and competing with retailers online, which is related to discrimination in employment. The summary also mentions the proliferation of e-commerce and the use of online marketplaces, which are related to violations of national legislation. Additionally, the summary mentions the need for online platforms to combat organized retail crime, which is related to both categories.

S.Y., whose lawsuit accuses major hotel chains of allowing sex trafficking, poses for a photograph.
""He came to clean up the water."" S.Y.'s lawsuit, in state court in Florida, is one of dozens filed across the country, largely in the past year and still in early legal stages, accusing some of the country's best-known hotel brands of ignoring sex trafficking at their properties.
The suits say that the hotel companies and franchisees profited from sex-trafficking operations being run out of their establishments and that they either were aware of it, or should have been.
Others are in state courts, like S.Y.'s, who is suing the hotels where she says she was trafficked and their parent companies, including Hilton and Wyndham.
""We require all our hotels, including franchises, to conduct training on identifying the signs of human trafficking and on how to report them,"" the spokesman said.
A Wyndham spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuits but said the company condemns human trafficking.
Marriott said it has trained more than 700,000 hotel workers to spot signs of human trafficking.
In February, a federal judge in Georgia dismissed hotel parent companies including Hilton and Wyndham from a case but said he was open to reconsidering his decision if the plaintiff presented new evidence.
Lawyers for the victims say consolidating the cases would help uniformly address some legal issues, such as hotels' request for traffickers' names.
Some hotels say they need the names to investigate the plaintiffs' claims, but lawyers for the women have argued the traffickers could retaliate against their clients.
S.Y. filed her lawsuit about three years after she said local police wearing tactical gear came into her hotel room brandishing guns in 2016.","S.Y., whose lawsuit accuses major hotel chains of allowing sex trafficking, poses for a photograph. PHOTO: Maria Alejandra Cardona for The Wall Street Journal During the three months that S.Y. was forced into prostitution, she said blood and used condoms littered the hotel rooms where she had sex in Naples, Fla. Skinny, underdressed women loitered in hotel lobbies while men wearing gold chains waited their turns, she said. Once, a woman was left unconscious in a hotel bathtub, causing a minor flood. S.Y. said she called the front-desk manager. ""He didn't come to help the girl in the bathtub,"" said S.Y., who spoke on condition that she be identified only by her initials, as she is in her lawsuit. ""He came to clean up the water."" S.Y.'s lawsuit, in state court in Florida, is one of dozens filed across the country, largely in the past year and still in early legal stages, accusing some of the country's best-known hotel brands of ignoring sex trafficking at their properties. Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc ., Marriott International Inc . and Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc . are among the defendants. The suits represent a rare use of a federal sex-trafficking statute against large corporate entities, legal experts say. In addition to monetary damages, the plaintiffs are seeking agreements that force hotel parent companies to implement broad measures to prevent trafficking, including at their franchises. The suits say that the hotel companies and franchisees profited from sex-trafficking operations being run out of their establishments and that they either were aware of it, or should have been. More than 40 of the suits were filed in federal courts. Others are in state courts, like S.Y.'s, who is suing the hotels where she says she was trafficked and their parent companies, including Hilton and Wyndham. Plaintiffs' lawyers said they expect to file at least dozens of similar suits in the next year. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How legally responsible should large hotel chains be for activities like prostitution that happen on their premises? Join the conversation below. The hotel companies have broadly argued in court documents that they have no control over what happens at franchised hotels and that they have implemented policies to prevent trafficking since many of the allegations occurred. The hotels have generally asked judges to toss the suits, but there have been few rulings on those motions so far. A spokesman for Hilton said it was committed to protecting people from exploitation. ""We require all our hotels, including franchises, to conduct training on identifying the signs of human trafficking and on how to report them,"" the spokesman said. A Wyndham spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuits but said the company condemns human trafficking. ""We also make training opportunities available for our franchised hotels, which are independently owned and operated,"" the spokesman said. Marriott said it has trained more than 700,000 hotel workers to spot signs of human trafficking. Hilton and Wyndham declined to comment on S.Y.'s allegations. The first federal suit was filed in Ohio in March of last year. A loosely organized group of plaintiffs' lawyers soon began searching for victims through advocacy-group referrals and online advertising, leading to a steady stream of lawsuits. The federal lawsuits rely on the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. The statute was amended in 2008 to allow for civil lawsuits against anyone who ""knew or should have known"" that sex trafficking occurred and financially benefited. ""If you can control the thread count of the bed sheets or the furniture in the lobby, you can control what mandates you are giving for anti-trafficking policies and efforts,"" said Kim Adams, a Florida-based lawyer whose firm represents women in Ohio, California and other states. The lawsuits describe common patterns. In most, either the women or their traffickers paid for rooms in cash, sometimes for weeks at a time. Many alleged victims were minors. The suits argue staff should have recognized signs of trafficking: bottles of lubricant, boxes of condoms and excessive requests for sheets and towels. Staffers saw men come to the same rooms, often more than a dozen each night, without luggage. Some accusers alleged they screamed for help or were beaten while doors were open. One accuser, H.H., says a hotel staffer found her chained in the bathroom in one Columbus, Ohio, hotel, and tied to a bed in a room in another, according to court documents. In Houston, one Jane Doe says she spent so much time at a hotel that she was befriended by its staff, who, seeing she was visibly malnourished, gave her snacks and small gifts, her lawsuit says. The suits also claim hotels should have known about online reviews that mention prostitution, arrests of traffickers on hotel premises and hospitality-industry presentations that document trafficking as a major concern. In October, U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley, the chief judge in the Southern District of Ohio, allowed one accuser's lawsuit against Wyndham to move forward. Judge Marbley found the accuser didn't sufficiently demonstrate Wyndham had knowledge of the purported trafficking, but did show it should have known, which is all the law requires. Judge Marbley issued a similar ruling in another case in December. In February, a federal judge in Georgia dismissed hotel parent companies including Hilton and Wyndham from a case but said he was open to reconsidering his decision if the plaintiff presented new evidence. This January, lawyers for the women asked that the federal cases be consolidated in front of a single judge, much like those in other mass torts like opioid litigation against pharmaceutical companies. A panel of judges denied the request, noting the suits had many different defendants. Lawyers for the victims say consolidating the cases would help uniformly address some legal issues, such as hotels' request for traffickers' names. Some hotels say they need the names to investigate the plaintiffs' claims, but lawyers for the women have argued the traffickers could retaliate against their clients. ""That's literally putting lives in danger,"" said Paul Pennock, another plaintiffs' lawyer involved in the effort. Mr. Pennock said the lawyers are considering renewing the consolidation request. S.Y. filed her lawsuit about three years after she said local police wearing tactical gear came into her hotel room brandishing guns in 2016. They arrested her two pimps, who she said gave her unlimited drugs and kept all of her earnings. Both have since been convicted of human trafficking and other crimes, according to her lawyer, Michael London. The men, now in state prison in Florida, couldn't be reached for comment. S.Y. said the hotels and their employeesâ€”including some who she said saw her walking around with black-and-blue marks on her neck from being strangledâ€”could have done more to help her. ""I wasn't chained here,"" said S.Y., who has since moved to another state and spent the past three years working her way up the ranks at a supermarket. ""But I had invisible chains holding me to these guys.""

Sushovan Hussain, a UK resident who was Autonomy's CFO at the time of its $11 billion acquisition by HP, was charged in an indictment filed on Thursday in federal court in San Francisco with conspiracy and wire fraud. The indictment alleged that beginning in October 2009, Hussain and others sought to deceive Autonomy's investors and HP about the company's performance, financial condition and prospects for growth. The scheme had several objectives, the indictment said, including to artificially increase and maintain Autonomy's share price to make the company attractive to potential buyers like HP. Hussain, who remains in the United Kingdom, has not been arrested. John Keker, his lawyer, said in a statement on Friday that Hussain was innocent and would be acquitted at trial. ""He defrauded no one and, as Autonomy's CFO, acted at all times with the highest standards of honesty, integrity and competence,"" Keker said. The indictment marked the latest fallout from the deal, which was supposed to form the central part of HP's move into software but instead led the U.S. company a year later to write-off three-quarters of Autonomy's value. Last year, HP sued Autonomy's co-founder Mike Lynch and Hussain, seeking $5.1 billion in a lawsuit that accused them of engaging in fraudulent activities to boost the company's value. Both men have denied wrongdoing. Lynch countersued HP last year, saying at the time that ""HP was simply incompetent in its operation of Autonomy, and the acquisition was doomed from the very beginning."" Hewlett Packard Enterprise did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for former Autonomy management, including Lynch and Hussain, said that the group is certain of Hussain's innocence and HP lied to the markets and shareholders. The case is U.S. v. Hussain, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 16-cr-00462.

We maintain our Market Perform rating on HP. Our valuation range of $15-$16.50 is based on roughly 10 times estimated fiscal 2017 earnings per share of $1.61. We believe HP has the right strategy to draw down supplies and increase product placement, but remains in transition at least until first-half 2017. Canon noted its laser printer unit sales improved in the fourth quarter driven by color models after declining year-over-year for the first three quarters of 2016. Canon also noted improvement in supplies sales, which exceeded internal expectations for the fourth quarter. Overall, laser printer sales declined 10.5% year-over-year (down 7.8% in constant currency (CC)), an improvement from 14.6% year-over-year decline in CC in the third quarter). Canon noted the inkjet market continued to decline with its sales down 11.1% year-over-year (4% in CC). For 2017, Canon expects the laser printer business to see some recovery with unit shipments roughly flat year-over-year driven by global economic growth (improvements in U.S., modest growth in Europe and Japan, and continued slowdown in China). Canon expects consumables sales to be roughly flat year-over-year. Xerox's equipment sales were down 12% year-over-year (10% in CC) and were impacted by weakness in high-end and timing of new product launches (pause ahead of 29 new products expected to be released in first-half 2017) while declines in annuity revenue (down 5% year-over-year, 3% at CC) were stable and consistent with prior quarters.

That may be about to change. Printing was the bread and butter of the old Hewlett-Packard Co., but consumers and businesses are printing less in an era filled with mobile devices. While continuing to deliver the majority of profits for the consumer focused spinoff HP (HPQ, US), printing sales slid each of the last five years and hit the lowest total since at least 1998 last year. https://dynamic-insets.s3.amazonaws.com/charts/cdc_59542012cd61eb0be6fc7a73_embed.htmlHowever, HPâ€™s most recent earnings report included a surprise: The first year-over-year gain for both printing and PC sales in the same quarter since 2010. Midway through its fiscal year, printing at HP is on track for some slight growth, and the company believes a play for millennials and adding to its product lines could at least cure the symptoms of printingâ€™s ills. MarketWatch recently sat down with HP Inc.â€™s (HPQ, US) president of printing and imaging, Enrique Lores, at its headquarters in Palo Alto, California. He noted that discipline in HPâ€™s biggest printing sales category, supplies, is a big reason for the recent growth. â€œItâ€™s a combination of fixing our core business and at the same time expanding and going into new opportunities,â€?Lores said, sitting in an HP living room-like demo area, surrounding by printer related products. Donâ€™t miss: HPâ€™s wish list includes retaking PC throne and making printing cool again The biggest immediate results stem from a clampdown on HPâ€™s supplies business, the ink that provides the most black for HPâ€™s profits. About seven months after HP Inc. and HP Enterprise Co. (HPE, US) became separate entities, executives at the PC and printing business realized they needed to clean up its supply chain, where a host of other resellers selling HPâ€™s ink cartridges and other products had produced an inconsistent market and pricing. Initially, when HP announced the moves last June, investors were concerned about the changes, which included two quarters of inventory write-downs and a decision to focus less on promotions. It also cut back on marketing funds it paid to resellers. But HP printing supplies revenue has easily topped estimates the last two quarters in a row and is well ahead of last yearâ€™s pace. To sell those supplies, though, you need demand. In the consumer print market, HP Inc. Chief Executive Dion Weisler has fully acknowledged that demand is in a secular decline. Last month, at a Bernstein Research conference, Weisler described HP as wanting to â€œreduce the glide slope of that decline.â€?So HP is reaching out to find new consumers: the millennial generation. The first approach has been on digital photography with small hand-held printers like the Sprocket, which prints photos from smartphones or tablets. â€œWe believe that many of the photographs taken today are in the digital jail,â€?Lores said. â€œYou take many, many pictures, but you never take them out again. We want to release them.â€?See also: PC companies must sell to businesses or die, but what about Apple? HPâ€™s consumer printing business has also far surpassed expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, especially in the holiday quarter. Consumer hardware revenue is on track to nearly double from last year. HP would not disclose unit shipment data on the Sprocket printer, though, and Lores said it was not financially material yet. â€œItâ€™s still relatively small, but in unit growth, it is strong,â€?he said. Rob Enderle, principal analyst with the Enderle Group, said that various resellers were pleased with the product, which is often sold out, and had described it as a â€œsurprising hit.â€?Another way consumers are buying is with HPâ€™s subscription service, which monitors ink usage and sends cartridges before you run out. Launched a few years ago, the service, Instant Ink, ultimately lowers the cost of printing by about 70%, Lores said, and has an â€œincredibly highâ€?retention rate. HP could use similar wins in its enterprise business, which is not growing. Attempts in that area include its PageWide inkjet technology, with a printer cartridge head that is as wide as a page but prints at a lower cost than laser printers. The company is also targeting the printing collateral marketâ€”advertisers, marketing agencies and makers of consumer goods that can be personalized, like Coke cans and Oreo packages with kidâ€™s names. â€œPersonalization really helps brands talk with their customers,â€?Lores said, adding that graphics make up about 15% of the printer business, a segment that has been growing steadily. Lores also has high hopes for HPâ€™s $1.05 billion acquisition of Samsungâ€™s printer business, set to close later this year. HP already had a deal to sell Samsungâ€™s A3 printers, copiers that combine the functions of printing. HP has never really made a strong foray into this sector of printing, and with Samsung, it has achieved some success, so it decided to buy the company. â€œWe are really excited about what the integration of Samsung brings,â€?Lores said. â€œThe combination of laser products from Samsung and PageWide gives us the strongest portfolio in the industry.â€?Opinion: Why HPE investors are wondering if they bet on wrong horse in split Wall Street has grown more optimistic about HP Inc.â€™s prospects, while the opposite is true about its sister company, HP Enterprise, which seriously disappointed investors this quarter with more talks of cost-cutting. HP has gained more than 21% so far this year, better than the S&P (SPX, US) ndexâ€™s 9% increase, while HPE has dropped 2.5%. Michelangelo Chart Chart ID 98dc9a64969a49608c365e9e6ab25d20 Symbol Headline Caption *only Chart ID can be edited above â€œWe have been working very hard since the separation to get back to profitable growth,â€?Lores said. The big question ahead is whether HP can turn any of its printing ambitions into growth larger than the 2% gains it reported last quarter. Right now, the consensus estimate on FactSet among analysts is that the total printing revenue will grow to $18.48 billion in fiscal 2017, up 1.2% from 2016 but still well lower than earlier printing sales. Disciplined management of ink, printers for smartphones and a larger selection of industrial printers donâ€™t seem to be killer products that will completely turn around a flagging business. On the horizon, probably within three to five years, the company could see some payoff from its investment into the nascent 3-D printing area, where it hopes to disrupt the $12 trillion manufacturing business. Until and unless that occurs, HP will likely continue to plug holes and hope the printing business can survive in its current form. â€œAt least they look like they have stabilized,â€?Enderle said.","<Incident Category>: fraud, poor employment conditions

HP Inc.,HPQ,2017/11/22,"poor employment conditions, supply chain issues, violation of national legislation","UPDATE 4-Meg Whitman stepping HP Enterprise CEO
* HPE president Antonio Neri named as Whitman's successor * Shares fall 6.2 pct after the bell * Whitman remains on Hewlett Packard Enterprise board (Adds Whitman's political ambitions and challenges, analyst commentary) By Pushkala Aripaka and Salvador Rodriguez Nov 21 (Reuters) - Meg Whitman on Tuesday announced that she will step down as chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, ending a 6-year tenure that included overseeing one of the biggest corporate breakups in history.
Whitman, one of the most powerful women in U.S. business and a former candidate for California governor, split Hewlett Packard Co into HPE and PC-and-printer business HP Inc in 2015 as part of a plan to turn around the large corporation.
Taking over for Whitman in February will be Antonio Neri, a relatively unknown HP executive who has been with the company for nearly a quarter century and currently serves as HPEâ€™s president.
Neri is a trained computer engineer and has worked in every one of HPE's businesses, Whitman said during the company's earnings call on Tuesday.
""I think it is absolutely the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins."" Neri will join HPE's board of directors and Whitman will remain on the board as well.
Although Whitman is one of the most prominent executives in Silicon Valley, with a career that spans startups and older businesses, she is not a household name in California, despite her run for governor, said Elliott Suthers, senior vice president with Grayling public communications and communications and media adviser for the McCain/Palin 2008 presidential campaign.","* HPE president Antonio Neri named as Whitman's successor * Shares fall 6.2 pct after the bell * Whitman remains on Hewlett Packard Enterprise board (Adds Whitman's political ambitions and challenges, analyst commentary) By Pushkala Aripaka and Salvador Rodriguez Nov 21 (Reuters) - Meg Whitman on Tuesday announced that she will step down as chief executive of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co, ending a 6-year tenure that included overseeing one of the biggest corporate breakups in history. Shares of HPE fell more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. Hewlett Packard Enterprises, known for its computer servers, is still adjusting to a new landscape in which corporate customers are placing more of their digital operations in the cloud and moving away from purchasing their own equipment. Whitman, one of the most powerful women in U.S. business and a former candidate for California governor, split Hewlett Packard Co into HPE and PC-and-printer business HP Inc in 2015 as part of a plan to turn around the large corporation. She aggressively shed assets and cut tens of thousand of jobs as HPE sharpened its focus on server and networking businesses. Taking over for Whitman in February will be Antonio Neri, a relatively unknown HP executive who has been with the company for nearly a quarter century and currently serves as HPEâ€™s president. Neri is a trained computer engineer and has worked in every one of HPE's businesses, Whitman said during the company's earnings call on Tuesday. Neri did not speak on the call. ""We have a much smaller, much nimbler, much more focused company,"" Whitman said during the call after Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said the move felt abrupt. ""I think it is absolutely the right time for Antonio and a new generation of leaders to take the reins."" Neri will join HPE's board of directors and Whitman will remain on the board as well. Whitman's retooling of HPE included September's spin off of HPE's enterprise services and software business to British software company MicroFocus International Plc and acquired companies, including Aruba and Nimble Storage. This month, HPE announced it is selling its Palo Alto, California, headquarters, which the company has held for six decades. Shares of HPE have risen nearly 47 percent since the split up, outpacing the 27.8 percent rise in the S&P 500 index during the same period. Whitman is leaving just as it is time for an executive with technical prowess to come in and retool the companyâ€™s offerings, said Ilya Kundozerov, equity analyst with Morningstar. ""HPE is more focused and more agile than ever before,"" Kundozerov said. ""A CEO with tech background can help HPE to improve its innovative edge.â€?Whitman, who previously headed eBay Inc, was reported to have been a leading candidate for chief executive job at Uber Technologies Inc before it was given to Dara Khosrowshahi. Whitman ran unsuccessfully for California governor in 2010, and she has served on the presidential campaigns of Republican former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. She endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. She stepped down from the board of HP Inc in July and joined the board of Dropbox in September. Whitman said on Tuesday's earnings call that she is ""going to take a little downtime, but thereâ€™s no chance Iâ€™m going to a competitor."" She told Reuters that she is not preparing another run for public office. ""I stay active in politics by contributing to candidates from both sides of the aisle who I agree with on core issues, but aside from that, I have no plans to get involved directly,â€?Whitman said in a statement. Although Whitman is one of the most prominent executives in Silicon Valley, with a career that spans startups and older businesses, she is not a household name in California, despite her run for governor, said Elliott Suthers, senior vice president with Grayling public communications and communications and media adviser for the McCain/Palin 2008 presidential campaign. ""To run against a relatively popular incumbent like  sheâ€™d need to spend record amounts to get within striking distance,â€?Suthers said. â€œOutside of Silicon Valley, sheâ€™s still a largely unknown quantity. Voters have a pretty short memory and her positions have undoubtedly shifted since 2010.â€?Separately, the company reported net income of $524 million, or 32 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with $302 million, or 18 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it reported earnings of 31 cents per share. Revenue rose 4.6 percent to $7.66 billion. Analysts were expecting fourth-quarter profit of 28 cents per share on revenue of $7.78 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

HP Inc.,HPQ,2017/11/29,"fraud, violation of national legislation","Ex-Autonomy executive cuts deal U.S. HP fraud probe
BOSTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A former executive at British software company Autonomy has agreed to become a cooperating witness to resolve U.S. charges that he and others schemed to deceive investors about the firm's performance before its sale to Hewlett Packard in 2011.
Federal prosecutors brought charges in November 2016 against Hussain, alleging that beginning in 2009, he and others sought to deceive Autonomy's investors and HP about the company's performance, financial condition and prospects for growth.
The deal was supposed to form the central part of HP's move into software but instead led the U.S. company a year later to write-off three-quarters of Autonomy's value.","BOSTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A former executive at British software company Autonomy has agreed to become a cooperating witness to resolve U.S. charges that he and others schemed to deceive investors about the firm's performance before its sale to Hewlett Packard in 2011. Christopher Egan, the former chief executive of Autonomy's U.S. subsidiary, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement in which he also admitted wrongdoing as part of a deal that could lead prosecutors to dismiss a case they filed this week against him. A copy of the agreement filed in federal court in San Francisco on Tuesday said the deal's terms were subject to the completion of a related case against former Autonomy Chief Financial Officer Sushovan Hussain. Egan in November 2016 agreed to pay more than $923,000 to resolve charges by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that he participated in a scheme to inflate Autonomy's revenue numbers from 2009 to 2011. ""From the day many years ago when concerns were first raised by HP, Christopher has never had any hesitation in coming forward to explain the role he played at Autonomy and forthrightly answer the government's questions,"" Miles Ehrlich, Egan's lawyer, said in a statement. A lawyer for Hussain, a UK resident who was Autonomy's CFO at the time of its $11 billion acquisition by HP, declined to comment. Hussain previously pleaded not guilty to conspiracy and wire fraud charges. Federal prosecutors brought charges in November 2016 against Hussain, alleging that beginning in 2009, he and others sought to deceive Autonomy's investors and HP about the company's performance, financial condition and prospects for growth. The scheme had several objectives, an indictment said, including to artificially increase and maintain Autonomyâ€™s share price to make the company attractive to potential buyers like HP, which agreed to buy it in 2011. The deal was supposed to form the central part of HP's move into software but instead led the U.S. company a year later to write-off three-quarters of Autonomy's value. Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co in September completed the spin-off of much of its software business, closing the door on the Autonomy deal. HPE was formed when the company once known as Hewlett-Packard split into HPE and HP Inc in November 2015. Hussain is scheduled to face trial on Jan. 29, according to court records. HP did not respond to a request for comment on Thursday. The case is U.S. v. Egan, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 17-cr-00590.

More companies are joining big brands including Unilever, Honda and Verizon in halting advertising on Facebook despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlining several steps the social network will take to combat hate speech.
""We do not believe that Facebook is effectively managing violent and divisive speech on their platform,"" said The Hershey Company in a statement.
""Despite repeated assertions by Facebook to take action, we have not seen meaningful change."" Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said it plans to pause advertising on all social media platforms for at least 30 days while it revisits its advertising policies.

Starbucks announced Sunday that it too would pause advertising on all social media platforms, saying ""we stand against hate speech."" Multiple companies have said they will halt advertising on the platform, citing Facebook's struggles to contain hate speech on its platform.
Several employees went on Twitter to protest the decision, while a group of former Facebook employees wrote an open letter published by The New York Times calling the company's move ""cowardly."" Zuckerberg said Friday Facebook plans to expand what qualifies as hateful content in ads, prohibiting ""claims that people from a specific race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status are a threat to the physical safety, health or survival of others."" The policies will also focus on ads targeting immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers.","More companies are joining big brands including Unilever, Honda and Verizon in halting advertising on Facebook despite CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlining several steps the social network will take to combat hate speech. On Friday night, The Hershey Company confirmed in a statement to USA TODAY it will join a boycott involving several companies that will halt advertising for July. Hershey also said it will cut spending on Facebook and Instagram by a third for the rest of the year. ""We do not believe that Facebook is effectively managing violent and divisive speech on their platform,"" said The Hershey Company in a statement. ""Despite repeated assertions by Facebook to take action, we have not seen meaningful change."" Meanwhile, Coca-Cola said it plans to pause advertising on all social media platforms for at least 30 days while it revisits its advertising policies. ""We also expect greater accountability and transparency from our social media partners,"" reads a statement from James Quincey, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. The latest advertising stoppages follow remarks Friday by Zuckerberg, who detailed multiple steps the company will take ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Ad boycott gains steam: Facebook ad boycott for July connects with another big name Facebook while black: Users call it getting 'Zucked,' say talking about racism is censored as hate speech Among the planned steps: pushing back against voter suppression, boosting standards for hateful content in ads, and labeling content deemed newsworthy. ""I'm optimistic that we can make progress on public health and racial justice while maintaining our democratic traditions around free expression and voting,"" wrote Zuckerberg. ""I'm committed to making sure Facebook is a force for good on this journey."" Starbucks announced Sunday that it too would pause advertising on all social media platforms, saying ""we stand against hate speech."" Multiple companies have said they will halt advertising on the platform, citing Facebook's struggles to contain hate speech on its platform. Verizon's decision is part of a larger #StopHateForProfit campaign, which includes the NAACP, Anti-Defamation League, Sleeping Giants, Color of Change, Free Press and Common Sense. After Coke joined the boycott, Rashad Robinson, president of civil rights organization Color Of Change, tweeted: ""One of the most recognizable global brands in the world is halting their @Facebook advertising. Coke's commitment to #StopHateForProfit, along with Unilever and Verizon just in the last 24 hours, is a warning sign for Facebook."" The ad boycott on Facebook focuses on advertising for the month of July, and features brands including Verizon, Eddie Bauer and Ben & Jerry's. ""If we're limited to 10 to 15 big name advertisers who join the boycott, I think it's more symbolic and it would have limited impact on Facebook's business."" said Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. ""The fear is that this snowballs into something much larger."" Earlier this week, during a speech at Cannes Lion Live, Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer for P&G, said the company would conduct a ""comprehensive review"" of where it is advertising. ""Where standards of responsibility and civility are not met, we will stop our spending, just like weâ€™ve done before,"" he said. Zuckerberg said any posts that would typically violate their policies but remain on the platform will include a label noting the content they are sharing may violate their policies. The co-founder and CEO also said they will not provide any exemptions to content that incites violence or suppresses voting. ""Even if a politician or government official says it, if we determine that content may lead to violence or deprive people of their right to vote, we will take that content down,"" he said. ""Similarly, there are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I'm announcing here today."" Facebook's policies surrounding divisive posts have been scrutinized after the platform left published a post from President Donald Trump following protests over the death of George Floyd. In the post, Trump said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Zuckerberg has defended leaving the post untouched, saying Facebook should allow for as much free expression as possible. A similar post published to Twitter carried a warning the tweet was ""glorifying violence."" ""People can agree or disagree on where we should draw the line, but I hope they understand our overall philosophy is that it is better to have this discussion out in the open, especially when the stakes are so high,"" Zuckerberg said earlier this month. The decision prompted outcry from both current and former employees urging more action. Several employees went on Twitter to protest the decision, while a group of former Facebook employees wrote an open letter published by The New York Times calling the company's move ""cowardly."" Zuckerberg said Friday Facebook plans to expand what qualifies as hateful content in ads, prohibiting ""claims that people from a specific race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status are a threat to the physical safety, health or survival of others."" The policies will also focus on ads targeting immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers.

IBM,IBM,2022/5/13,executive compensation issues,"Optimist Helm IBM
In a tech industry dominated by Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, it can be easy to forget that much of the humdrum work that makes screens flicker, servers hum and businesses run is performed by companies that rarely make the headlines, companies that have been gradually shaping the computer business for decades, companies like IBM.
Mr. Krishna, who grew up in India before coming to the United States to get his Ph.D., has spent most of his career at IBM, and recently led the companyâ€™s acquisition of Red Hat. Yet running a company as large as IBM requires more than just good business chops these days.
And IBM â€?which has been engaging with diversity, equity and inclusion issues for decades â€?is being forced to contend with a social and political landscape that demands companies take a stand on hot-button topics.
Because when somebody like that is asking you to work with him on your thesis, you realize anything youâ€™re doing, he can do twice as fast, and heâ€™s got such a clear brain that he gets that instantly right.
Through the â€?0s, IBM was one of the last companies really clinging to this sort of cradle-to-the-grave mentality when it came to employment.
That changed very abruptly when Lou Gerstner came in and fired hundreds of thousands of people.
He took 200,000 people out in the first two years.
Itâ€™s going to be cloud and A.I., and we should focus the company around those.
How do you recruit young engineers when companies like Amazon and Meta and Google and Microsoft are flying very, very high right now?
We also attract people who want to work on really hard problems.
This requires people with the patience to spend two, three, five years to make it successful.
How is IBM handling the return-to-work situation, and what do you expect the future of the office to look like?
In India, we just reopened our offices and people are trickling in.
Germany has people in the offices.
Amsterdam has people in the offices.
Spain has people in the offices.
I think people are getting a little bit hungry for more work interaction, not just social interaction.
IBM has a history of involving itself in difficult social and political issues, including being among the first companies to offer benefits to same-sex partners of employees in 1996.","In a tech industry dominated by Apple, Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft, it can be easy to forget that much of the humdrum work that makes screens flicker, servers hum and businesses run is performed by companies that rarely make the headlines, companies that have been gradually shaping the computer business for decades, companies like IBM. Over the past 30 years, IBM has changed drastically, becoming a major player in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. And during those decades, Arvind Krishna was rising through the ranks of Big Blue, becoming chief executive in January 2020. Mr. Krishna, who grew up in India before coming to the United States to get his Ph.D., has spent most of his career at IBM, and recently led the companyâ€™s acquisition of Red Hat. Yet running a company as large as IBM requires more than just good business chops these days. The pandemic hit just as Mr. Krishna took over, forcing him to grapple with remote work, a splintered corporate culture and market turbulence. And IBM â€?which has been engaging with diversity, equity and inclusion issues for decades â€?is being forced to contend with a social and political landscape that demands companies take a stand on hot-button topics. This interview was condensed and edited for clarity. Tell me a bit about your life growing up in India. My father was a reasonably senior officer in the Indian Army. Consequently, we grew up all over the country, moving every couple of years. He was always very, very focused on what is the outcome of what youâ€™re doing, which is good, given his profession to defend the country. He had to make sure that the troops performed and all the equipment worked. How did you get involved in the tech business? In schoolI actually enjoyed history. I enjoyed math, enjoyed physics, enjoyed a lot of things. But somewhere along the way, I really became interested in figuring out how things work. I began to think about that and say: How do you make a career at the intersection of physics, math and the real world? And thatâ€™s engineering. And then you came to the United States for your Ph.D.? When I finished my graduate work, I got to work with an amazing professor, Bruce Hajek of the University of Illinois, who really encouraged me to find my way. I will never be as engineering smart as he was â€?it was simply amazing. He was a full professor by the age of 29, a member of the National Academy of Engineering, all kinds of government advisory boards, and he was winner of the Math Olympiad. He taught me humility. Because when somebody like that is asking you to work with him on your thesis, you realize anything youâ€™re doing, he can do twice as fast, and heâ€™s got such a clear brain that he gets that instantly right. But he walks with you because he wants to teach. He wants you to learn how to do it, as opposed to him doing it for you. That really teaches you a lot about how you have to interact with people. Through the â€?0s, IBM was one of the last companies really clinging to this sort of cradle-to-the-grave mentality when it came to employment. That changed very abruptly when Lou Gerstner came in and fired hundreds of thousands of people. You were there around this time, and I wonder if you can talk to me about the culture change as you saw it, and to what extent you believe it was necessary and to what extent perhaps there was an overcorrection. He took 200,000 people out in the first two years. Moments like that are catastrophic. So I donâ€™t think that should be a useful tool unless youâ€™re in that kind of circumstance. But I really do believe there should be a performance culture. And I believe it was absolutely essential. No company in the public markets can survive by losing money. And I donâ€™t think there was an overcorrection at that time. You were named C.E.O. just as Covid hit. How have you managed the company in these first couple years? I was named C.E.O. on Jan. 30, 2020. In hindsight, we should have known Covid was around the corner and actually spent the prior week preparing. It was pretty obvious something major was going to happen. We could have just hunkered down, battened down the hatches and hoped for the best. But we knew we needed to make some changes. We knew that we should go make the company much more straightforward in some areas, because I had a very clear view that the technologies are going to transform our clientsâ€?experience. Itâ€™s going to be cloud and A.I., and we should focus the company around those. How do you recruit young engineers when companies like Amazon and Meta and Google and Microsoft are flying very, very high right now? This has not changed since I finished graduate school. I remember back in â€?9, the highfliers were Cisco and Sun. Now theyâ€™re not. So this stuff comes and goes. Our answer has been always very different. No. 1, we like to go to where the talent is. So we have a global footprint on talent. Weâ€™re not confined to any one country and only one campus. We also attract people who want to work on really hard problems. This requires people with the patience to spend two, three, five years to make it successful. So do we get our fair share? Iâ€™d say so. We always have to worry about it. And if itâ€™s not a cradle to grave, they have to feel that theyâ€™ve become more marketable, that they learned something while theyâ€™re here. Are you having a hard time getting the talent you need right now? Not really, no. We have a few thousand openings. We have tens of thousands of new hires. How is IBM handling the return-to-work situation, and what do you expect the future of the office to look like? I was in the U.K. recently and we had a few hundred people in the building not wearing masks and being together. The buzz was incredible. In India, we just reopened our offices and people are trickling in. Germany has people in the offices. Amsterdam has people in the offices. Spain has people in the offices. I think people are getting a little bit hungry for more work interaction, not just social interaction. Thereâ€™s a group that really enjoys being in the workplace. Theyâ€™re more productive. They enjoy the environment. IBM has a history of involving itself in difficult social and political issues, including being among the first companies to offer benefits to same-sex partners of employees in 1996. How do you decide what a company should take a stand on? You canâ€™t comment on every single thing, otherwise itâ€™s just noise. So you go back to your values. The first value we focus on is that we want to be an inclusive workplace. That was way before the â€?0s. That goes back to the 1930s, when Thomas Watson Sr. put the first women in executive ranks. It goes back to the 1940s, when Watson Jr. began to put the first Black people in management ranks. The same-sex benefits was a continuation of that. So when it comes to issues like bathroom bills in North Carolina or transgender laws in Texas, weâ€™re willing to speak up and really get very vocal with state government. But IBM is one of the few companies that stops short of donating money to politicians. Why is that? Itâ€™s a slippery slope. If you pay money to somebody, are you just trying to buy your way into something by doing that? What happens if your candidate doesnâ€™t win?

The European Commission's announcement confirmed a Reuters story last week. Illumina announced the $8 billion cash-and-stock deal for startup Grail last September, buying out investors including Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, to regain control of a company it spun out five years ago. Grail makes a non-invasive, early detection biopsy test to screen for many kinds of cancers using DNA sequencing. The EU executive, which acts as the competition enforcer for the 27-country bloc, said its preliminary investigation showed that Illumina could have an economic incentive to block Grail's cancer detection rivals. ""It is very important to preserve market conditions, allowing the best solutions to emerge for the tests to ultimately reach the market at affordable prices,"" Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. The EU watchdog will decide by Nov. 29 whether to clear or block the deal. Illumina said it will work with the Commission but warned against a veto of the deal. ""Re-uniting GRAIL with Illumina will accelerate availability of the GRAIL test by many years in the EEA and globally, saving tens of thousands of lives, and leading to significant health care cost savings,"" said CEO Francis deSouza in a statement. In Washington, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission has filed a complaint seeking to block the deal, arguing that Illumina is the sole provider of the DNA sequencing that Grail uses and could prevent others from entering the market. To address antitrust concerns, deSouza told Reuters on Thursday that Illumina had offered a 12-year contract to supply its technology to potential rivals. He also argued that Illumina was best placed to broadly market the test. ""This is all about access,"" he said of the proposed deal. ""This will be a test for the rich otherwise, for a while."" The deal will face an August trial at the FTC. While seeking EU approval for the deal, Illumina is also challenging in court the EU decision to examine it even though it does not meet the revenue criteria. Regulators say such powers are necessary to prevent companies buying rival start-ups to close them down. Critics however say it creates uncertainties for companies.

The national police chief indicated that he believed Dr. Sanon, 63, was plotting to assume the presidency, but offered no explanation for how the doctor could possibly have taken control of the government. Haitian officials have also implicated at least 20 Colombians, describing them as centerpieces of a well-organized plan carried out by â€œforeign mercenaries.â€?Officials say Dr. Sanon hired a private Florida security company that recruited at least some of the Colombians. But their role in the killing, if any, is murky. Colombia is investigating several trips that one of MoÃ¯seâ€™s top security aides made to BogotÃ¡ in the months before the assassination. Haitiâ€™s lead prosecutor is also investigating what role Haitian security forces may have had in the killing. Many wonder how the assailants got through such a fortified compound defended by Haitian security forces with no other deaths. Huge protests shake Cuba The biggest protest movement in decades is sweeping Cuba, as thousands of citizens took to the streets on Sunday to protest power outages, food shortages and a worrying lack of medicine. The island faces a dire economic crisis, as the coronavirus pandemic has cut off crucial tourism dollars. People wait in line for hours to buy food. Many have been unable to work, and families are growing desperate. The country, known for quashing dissent, has not experienced protests of this scale in nearly 30 years. Quotable: â€œI took to the streets because Iâ€™m tired of being hungry,â€?said Sara Naranjo, a demonstrator, in a video shared on Twitter. â€œI donâ€™t have water, I donâ€™t have anything,â€?she said. â€œYou get bored, you get tired, we are going crazy.â€?Cubaâ€™s reaction: The government attributes its longstanding economic problems to the American trade embargo, which cuts off its access to financing and imports. Cubaâ€™s president, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel BermÃºdez, blamed the U.S. for an underhanded campaign to exploit peoplesâ€?emotions. U.S. reaction: President Biden called on the Cuban government to heed the demonstratorsâ€?demands. â€œWe stand with the Cuban people and their clarion call for freedom,â€?he said in a statement. Democrats and Republicans alike spoke out in support of the demonstrations. Another J&J vaccine warning The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will warn that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine can lead to a rare neurological condition known as Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome. The announcement could come as early as Tuesday. The risk is extremely low: Officials have identified about 100 suspected cases out of nearly 13 million people in the U.S. who received the shot. One recipient, a 57-year-old man who had both a stroke and a heart attack within the last four years, died in April. U.S. context: The F.D.A. has decided that its benefits strongly outweigh the risk. Still, the news is the latest setback for the vaccine, which has been largely sidelined in the U.S. by manufacturing and safety issues. Millions of doses are sitting unused and will expire this summer, as the national pace of vaccination has slowed. International context: After the U.S. paused distribution over concerns of rare blood clots, several countries followed suit. The controversial decision to pause the shot slowed vaccination campaigns and caused demand to plummet. Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic. In other developments: * Officials will most likely extend the lockdown in Sydney, Australia. * England will go forward with its plan to lift most remaining coronavirus restrictions on July 19, despite rising case numbers. * Migrant workers in South Asia are stranded, unable to return to jobs or gain access to vaccines. * Fox News continues to spread misinformation about shots, even as outbreaks spread among unvaccinated Americans. THE LATEST NEWS * Gen. Austin Miller stepped down as the leader of the U.S. force in Afghanistan, a big transition as the Taliban gains more territory. * Italy beat England in the Euro 2020 final. Angry fans flooded social media with racist attacks against three of Englandâ€™s Black players, who missed penalty kicks in a decisive shootout. * Nepal stripped its prime minister of his duties and reinstated the Parliament that he had twice dissolved in recent months. * A Jordanian court sentenced two men close to King Abdullah II to 15 years in prison for trying to destabilize the monarchy. * The E.P.A. approved the use of â€œforever chemicalsâ€?for fracking in 2011, a new report shows, despite its own concern about toxicity and health risks. * A group of Texas Democrats fled the state in a last-ditch effort to block a restrictive voting law by preventing Republicans from attaining a necessary quorum. * An out-of-control wildfire has scorched more than 150,000 acres in Oregon, threatening the power grid and displacing residents. * The Biden administration will send most families up to $300 a month per child, a progressive milestone that aligns the U.S. with many other rich countries.

ARTS AND IDEAS Jane Goodall talks morality and hope At 87, the primatologist, educator and activist Jane Goodall is staying hopeful and sharing reflections about ethics, political posturing and plodding on to make the world a better place. Have you ever wondered if tapping into fear and anger might be useful in telling stories about the planet and conservation? No. Itâ€™s one of my big complaints when I talk to the media: Yes, we absolutely need to know all the doom and gloom because we are approaching a crossroads, and if we donâ€™t take action it could be too late. But traveling the world Iâ€™d see so many projects of restoration, animal and plant species being rescued from the brink of extinction, people tackling what seemed impossible and not giving up. Those are the stories that should have equal time, because theyâ€™re what gives people hope. Are there ideas you have about conservation that you feel are too radical to express publicly? Absolutely. I would never approach people about the crisis of billions of animals in the factory farms and say youâ€™ve got to be vegan. People have to change gradually. Are chimps capable of evil? This is a very interesting philosophical conversation, and Iâ€™ve thought about it a lot. My definition is that only humans can be evil. Chimpanzees can be brutal, violent, aggressive. But my definition of evil, itâ€™s when you can plan attacks on those who arenâ€™t there and then carry them out in cold blood. Chimps donâ€™t plan like that.

States unveiled a historic $26 billion settlement with drug companies to resolve thousands of opioid-crisis lawsuits, paving the way for communities across the country to secure a jolt of funding to address an epidemic in painkiller addiction that hasn't abated.
The nation's three largest drug distributorsâ€”McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp., and Cardinal Health Inc.â€”and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson have been negotiating the deal for more than two years, but Wednesday's announcement signifies an important milestone that could clear the way for money to be received by states as soon as early next year.
States can't use the money to fill general budget holes, as they did after a $206 billion deal with tobacco companies in the 1990s.
McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal said in a joint statement that they dispute the allegations against them but believe the deal is an important step toward resolving the claims and ""delivering meaningful relief to communities across the United States."" Johnson & Johnson's general counsel, Michael Ullmann, said, ""We recognize the opioid crisis is a tremendously complex public health issue,"" adding that the funds will help address the problem.

The nation's three largest drug distributorsâ€”McKesson Corp., AmerisourceBergen Corp., and Cardinal Health Inc.â€”and drugmaker Johnson & Johnson have been negotiating the deal for more than two years, but Wednesday's announcement signifies an important milestone that could clear the way for money to be received by states as soon as early next year. States can't use the money to fill general budget holes, as they did after a $206 billion deal with tobacco companies in the 1990s. Instead, the majority must be spent on social services to address the harms of opioid addiction, like treatment programs, education on how to dispose of pills and needles, and bolstered funds for first responders. One community may use it to help a large problem of addiction in the homeless population, while another may be more focused on opioid-addicted babies. ""It won't be used to fill potholes, or build libraries, or balance budgets,"" said Paul Geller, a plaintiffs' lawyer representing several cities and counties involved in the deal. Individuals and families who have been affected by opioid abuse won't receive any money directly. An opioid crisis that has claimed half a million lives in the U.S. has triggered more than 3,000 lawsuits filed by states, local governments, Native American tribes, hospital groups and others against players in the pharmaceutical industry. The lawsuits allege drugmakers pushed their painkillers for uses far beyond what was medically necessary and that distributors and pharmacies didn't do enough to halt masses of pills from flowing into communities. Drug addiction got worse during the pandemic, with opioid overdose deaths up about 37% in 2020 from the prior year, according to government data. The companies pushed back, saying they made and distributed a medically necessary and federally regulated product. But at the same time, the burdens of litigationâ€”like turning over millions of internal documents, making employees available for depositions, and preparing for complex trials that could air embarrassing detailsâ€”has sent many of the companies to the negotiating table. The attorneys general from Tennessee, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New York, Louisiana, Delaware and Connecticut jointly announced the completed deal Wednesday, which had been rumored earlier this week. ""There's not enough money in the world frankly to address the pain and the suffering and the tragedy of the families all of us know in our states,"" Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said. The broad terms call for the three distributors to pay up to $21 billion collectively over a period of 18 years, and for Johnson & Johnson to contribute $5 billion over nine years. The amounts could decrease if not enough states sign on, and the companies can still walk away if they decide the level of participation doesn't buy them the global peace they are seeking to put the lawsuits behind them. McKesson, AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal said in a joint statement that they dispute the allegations against them but believe the deal is an important step toward resolving the claims and ""delivering meaningful relief to communities across the United States."" Johnson & Johnson's general counsel, Michael Ullmann, said, ""We recognize the opioid crisis is a tremendously complex public health issue,"" adding that the funds will help address the problem. Shares for the four companies rose this week after news reports, including from The Wall Street Journal, that the settlement was expected to come this week. Analysts said the development was positive, although investors likely baked the settlement amount into stock prices since the amounts have been known, and noted that the wholesalers have reserved cash to make the payments. However, some analysts said companies that didn't reach settlements this week, such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., still face a risk because it is unclear when they may resolve the litigation and, potentially, what it would cost them. Completing the deal took thousands of hours of negotiations between private plaintiffs' lawyers representing communities, state attorneys general, and lawyers for the four companies. Frequent in-person meetings gave way to nightly Zoom calls held for months during the pandemic. The final details came together as opioid lawsuits went to trial in three states, putting pressure on both sides. Jurors in New York saw joking emails that employees at one distributor sent about addicts, including one that circulated a song about ""Pillbillies"" set to the theme of ""The Beverly Hillbillies."" The settlements, if completed, would resolve the opioid lawsuits for these four companies, but several other targets remain. Trials are under way in California and New York against drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Ltd., AbbVie Inc.'s Allergan, and Endo International PLC. National pharmacy chains have also been named in hundreds of suits and are scheduled to go to trial in October. Two other companies that were targets of the suits, including OxyContin-maker Purdue Pharma LP, filed for bankruptcy to handle the liability and are negotiating their own settlements with states. The deal terms give states 30 days to join or reject the settlement. If the companies decide enough states are participating, local governments will have another few months to lend support. The amount a state ultimately receives hinges largely on recruiting its municipalities to join. If a state government opts out, then its counties or cities won't be able to access the money. Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington state said he is rejecting the settlement because the $30 million a year that could flow to the state isn't the ""transformative amount of money"" needed to deal with the devastation from the opioid crisis. The state has upcoming trial dates against the four companies, and Mr. Ferguson said he plans to go forward. The percentage of the $26 billion allocated to each state is based on the population and the impact of opioid addiction in each region. Beyond the money involved, the distributors have agreed to create a clearinghouse intended to help the companies better spot suspicious drug orders. For the first time, AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and McKesson would be able to see where their competitors are sending pills, which the architects of the deal say would better enable them to spot pharmacies from which drugs are being diverted for illegal uses. ""This settlementâ€¦puts in place controls that will go a long way to making sure this never happens again,"" Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said. Johnson & Johnson, which used to provide a raw ingredient used in painkillers to other companies and stopped selling its own handful of opioid painkillers in the U.S. last year, agreed to stay out of the opioid business for the next decade. Just over $2 billion of the overall amount will go toward attorney fees and expenses, the majority of that to private plaintiffs' lawyers who represented thousands of cities and counties and some states. Gary Wellendorf of Youngstown, Ohio, who used or abused opioids for 40 years and lost his wife to an overdose, said he hopes some of the money can be spent on making treatment programs available for those who can't afford it. ""It's a split-second decision to get help,"" said Mr. Wellendorf, who is 63 years old, adding that few options are available without insurance or funding. If veterans' benefits hadn't picked up the cost of his addiction treatment a few years ago, he said, ""I'd probably be dead."" Jared S. Hopkins contributed to this article.

The world's largest health-products company by sales will separate its high-margin but less predictable prescription-drug and medical-device businesses from its storied but slower-growing consumer group, creating two publicly traded companies.
""The best path forward to ensure sustainable growth over the long term and better meet patient and consumer demands is to have our consumer business operate as a separate healthcare company,"" Mr. Gorsky said in an interview.
What form the separation will take, what the new consumer-oriented company will be called and who will lead it are yet to be worked out, Mr. Gorsky said, though he said J&J planned to structure the transaction to be tax-free.
It is likely J&J would spin out its consumer unit and hold a stock offering, but no decision has been made, Mr. Gorsky said.
The trimmer J&J, which will keep the name, will still stand as the world's largest health-products company, with yearly sales approaching $80 billion, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said.
The consumer division has generally contributed the smallest profit of J&J's three main divisions, less than the contribution from prescription-drug sales or medical-device sales.
While J&J's pharmaceutical sales have surged in recent years, the consumer business was recovering from a series of recalls, including of millions of bottles of Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines in 2009 and 2010, because of manufacturing problems.
At times in the mid-2000s, J&J's consumer business was posting the strongest sales growth of the three main units.
The unit was bolstered in 2006, when J&J bought Pfizer Inc.'s consumer business, including Listerine, for $16.6 billion.
For J&J, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the divergent potential of its pharmaceutical and consumer businesses and intensified discussions among board members about separating them, Mr. Gorsky said.
Rockoff at Jonathan.Rockoff@wsj.com and Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com Johnson & Johnson to Split Consumer From Pharmaceutical, Medical-Device Businesses, Creating Two Companies","Johnson & Johnson plans to break up into two companies, splitting off the $15-billion-a-year division that sells Band-Aid bandages, Tylenol medicines and Johnson's Baby Powder in a shift indicating just how much healthcare has changed since the company helped pioneer the industry. The world's largest health-products company by sales will separate its high-margin but less predictable prescription-drug and medical-device businesses from its storied but slower-growing consumer group, creating two publicly traded companies. J&J will shed its consumer division in 18 to 24 months, Chief Executive Alex Gorsky said. J&J decided to make the change, he said, because the businesses, their customers and markets have diverged so much in recent years, including during the pandemic. Lawsuits that alleged use of Johnson's Baby Powder caused cancer didn't play a role, he said. ""The best path forward to ensure sustainable growth over the long term and better meet patient and consumer demands is to have our consumer business operate as a separate healthcare company,"" Mr. Gorsky said in an interview. What form the separation will take, what the new consumer-oriented company will be called and who will lead it are yet to be worked out, Mr. Gorsky said, though he said J&J planned to structure the transaction to be tax-free. It is likely J&J would spin out its consumer unit and hold a stock offering, but no decision has been made, Mr. Gorsky said. The decision comes after rivals including Pfizer Inc. and Merck & Co. decided to hive off their consumer businesses and double down on faster-growing pharmaceuticals. This week, General Electric Co. said it would break into three public companies, another example of large, diversified companies reassessing their structures and seeking to find stronger growth by separating into smaller units focused on their core competencies. The trimmer J&J, which will keep the name, will still stand as the world's largest health-products company, with yearly sales approaching $80 billion, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said. The consumer company will be among the industry's largest, after competitors such as Procter & Gamble Co., NestlÃ© SA and L'OrÃ©al SA. J&J shares rose more than 1% Friday on the news. ""Given that there is not much synergy between the consumer business and the other JNJ segments, this initiative makes sense,"" Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said in a note to investors. The separation will kick off the biggest change in direction in J&J's 135-year history. Disposable diapers, indigestion tablets and cough remedies powered J&J during its first century, then provided the diversification that helped the company ride out the ups and downs of its riskier but higher-reward pharmaceuticals and medical-devices businesses. The decision to pull all Tylenol from store shelves during a safety scare in 1982 endeared J&J to many consumers. Today, the consumer-health business sells well-known brandsâ€”from Neutrogena skin moisturizers to Zyrtec allergy pillsâ€”that include four that ring up $1 billion in sales each year and 20 generating more than $150 million in annual sales. The unit is also home to J&J's namesake brand, Johnson's Baby. The division has grown apart from J&J's other units in recent years. Sales are growing more slowly than at the other businesses, and have lower margins. It depends on recognition of name brands such as Aveeno, Neutrogena and Listerine, which are marketed directly to consumers. Endorsements by celebrities and sales via e-commerce websites increasingly play the decisive role in commercial success. ""People are now looking to folks that they idolize and say, 'If that product works for them, it's going to work for me, too,' "" Mr. Wolk said in an interview. Prescription drugs and medical devices require different corporate skill sets. They undergo tight regulatory scrutiny before they can go on sale and are monitored closely afterward. Their commercial success depends heavily on the choices of doctors and hospitals as well as payment by health insurers. Prescription drugs and devices also spring from more-advanced research than consumer goods. The next-generation drugs and devices are requiring yearslong and heavy investments in research into human genetics and molecular biology, artificial intelligence and optical recognition. J&J's pharmaceuticals business, which sells therapies for diseases ranging from prostate cancer to pulmonary arterial hypertension, developed one of only three Covid-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. Wall Street also has different expectations for the businesses. The consumer unit's sales rose 1.1% to $15 billion last year, after growth of 0.3% the previous year. In contrast, J&J's pharmaceutical unit posted sales growth of 8% last year and 3.6% the previous year. The consumer division has generally contributed the smallest profit of J&J's three main divisions, less than the contribution from prescription-drug sales or medical-device sales. While J&J's pharmaceutical sales have surged in recent years, the consumer business was recovering from a series of recalls, including of millions of bottles of Tylenol and other over-the-counter medicines in 2009 and 2010, because of manufacturing problems. In addition, it has faced lawsuits alleging talc-containing Johnson's Baby Powder caused cancer or mesothelioma. J&J has said its talc-containing baby powder is safe, doesn't contain asbestos and doesn't cause cancer. It created a subsidiary and placed it in bankruptcy to resolve the talc claims quickly. Mr. Gorsky said J&J has corrected the manufacturing issues that led to recalls. It upgraded the plant in Fort Washington, Pa., that makes Tylenol. In July, the Food and Drug Administration lifted a consent decree that had put three consumer-division manufacturing plants under scrutiny. One risk of splitting off the consumer division is that J&J will have less of a buffer to smooth out sales and profit if one of the remaining divisions stumbles or encounters a market downturn. J&J has long touted its diversified business model as a strength. At various points, weakness in one unit would be offset by strong sales in another. At times in the mid-2000s, J&J's consumer business was posting the strongest sales growth of the three main units. The unit was bolstered in 2006, when J&J bought Pfizer Inc.'s consumer business, including Listerine, for $16.6 billion. A stand-alone consumer business, however, won't be able to draw on a well-endowed parent while it competes with bigger rivals. The new company will be in a better position standing alone to allocate resources and make other decisions, said Joaquin Duato, vice chairman of J&J's executive committee, who will become chief executive in January and eventually lead the pharmaceutical and medical-device company. The leaner J&J, he said, will remain diversified by providing products for a range of diseases and based on various technologies, from cellular therapy to robotic-assisted surgery. The remaining J&J, he added, will intensify efforts to create products that combine medical devices with drugs, such as one in development that identifies lung tumors and then targets them with a cancer therapy. Another experimental product aims to treat bladder-cancer patients using a device that delivers a drug. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What does Johnson & Johnson's split mean for the future of the company? Join the conversation below. The split, Mr. Duato said in an interview, ""is going to create two strong companies with fit-for-purpose models for the changing trajectory of health."" Rival drugmakers have also been shedding units selling cough pills, daily vitamins and skin lotions in recent years. In 2019, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline combined their over-the-counter businesses into a joint venture, GSK Consumer Healthcare, which sells pain medicine Advil. Merck sold its consumer business, which makes Coppertone sunscreen, to Bayer AG for $14.2 billion in 2014. For J&J, the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated the divergent potential of its pharmaceutical and consumer businesses and intensified discussions among board members about separating them, Mr. Gorsky said.

Limits J.&J. Covid Vaccine
WASHINGTON â€?In yet another setback for Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s coronavirus vaccine, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday limited its use to adults who cannot or refuse to get the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines, citing safety concerns.
The F.D.A. said that weighing the risks of Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s vaccine against the benefits, it had decided to limit its use to adults who cannot access Pfizerâ€™s or Modernaâ€™s vaccines, or for whom those shots are not â€œclinically appropriate.â€?One example would be people who experienced an extreme allergic reaction to the other two vaccines, the agency said.
It said the vaccine could also be given to adults who â€œwould otherwise not receive a Covid-19 vaccine.â€?Johnson & Johnson was eclipsed long ago by Pfizer and Moderna in the nationâ€™s vaccination campaign; federal officials have said the mRNA vaccines produced by those companies are both safer and more effective.
In its announcement, the F.D.A. cited more than six cases and close to one death attributed to the blood-clotting disorder for every two million shots of Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered in the United States.","The agency said the move reflected an updated analysis of the risk of a rare but serious blood-clotting condition in people who get the vaccine.

The agency said 60 cases of a rare but serious blood-clotting disorder have been identified, including nine deaths, out of about 18 million doses administered. The action comes about five months after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Modernaâ€™s and Pfizerâ€™s vaccines over Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s for booster shots. The F.D.A. said that weighing the risks of Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s vaccine against the benefits, it had decided to limit its use to adults who cannot access Pfizerâ€™s or Modernaâ€™s vaccines, or for whom those shots are not â€œclinically appropriate.â€?One example would be people who experienced an extreme allergic reaction to the other two vaccines, the agency said. It said the vaccine could also be given to adults who â€œwould otherwise not receive a Covid-19 vaccine.â€?Johnson & Johnson was eclipsed long ago by Pfizer and Moderna in the nationâ€™s vaccination campaign; federal officials have said the mRNA vaccines produced by those companies are both safer and more effective. In a statement, Johnson & Johnson said the F.D.A.â€™s action reflected the already-known risk of the side effect, not new data on the rate at which it occurs. But in a sign of the firmâ€™s own flagging interest in its vaccine, it has stopped providing sales outlooks for the shot to investors. Reports that the vaccine can trigger a condition known as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome have bedeviled it from early on. In April 2021, not long after it was approved for emergency use, federal authorities paused distribution of the vaccine for a safety evaluation. Regulators lifted the pause 10 days later but added a warning to instructions for its use. Then, in December, the C.D.C. recommended that adults seeking a booster shot choose Moderna or Pfizer instead of Johnson & Johnson, citing more benefits and lower risks. Coupled with a host of manufacturing troubles in the United States, some experts said, the agencyâ€™s judgment illustrated that the federal government had all but written off Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s vaccine. According to the F.D.A. announcement on Thursday, federal authorities now have 60 reports of the blood-clotting disorder â€?or four times as many as were reported when last yearâ€™s pause in distribution was lifted. In the interim, the number of Johnson & Johnson doses administered has slightly more than doubled, while the number of Pfizer and Moderna recipients has skyrocketed. The number of deaths attributed to the disorder triggered by the Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s vaccine does not appear to have risen much, if at all. But there have been far fewer, if any, suspected deaths due to side effects from the mRNA vaccines, federal health officials have said. In its announcement, the F.D.A. cited more than six cases and close to one death attributed to the blood-clotting disorder for every two million shots of Johnson & Johnson vaccine administered in the United States. About 17 million Americans have now gotten one dose of Johnson & Johnsonâ€™s vaccine, and another 1.5 million have gotten a booster dose, according to the C.D.C.â€™s data. By comparison, more than 200 million Americans have gotten at least two doses of either Modernaâ€™s or Pfizerâ€™s vaccine. Trying to cast the tight new restrictions in a positive light, Johnson & Johnson said: â€œData continue to support a favorable benefit-risk profile for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine in adults, when compared with no vaccine.â€?

As a result, J&J is being more selective in its spending including hiring new employees, Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said. ""It's forcing us to probably be a little bit more discretionary in terms of investments we're able to make,"" he said. He added that J&J will give priority to research and development, however, for which spending rose 9.1% in the second quarter. The company now sees full-year sales up between 2.1% and 3.1%, down from a prior guidance of 3.8% to 4.8%. J&J now expects adjusted earnings for the year to grow between 2.1% and 3.1%, down from a prior forecast of 3.6% to 5.6%. Johnson & Johnson said on Tuesday the lowered view is largely due to the stronger dollar. The new guidance comes as the company reported a 3% increase in sales in its second quarter. Currency-exchange trends reduced overall sales growth by 5 percentage points. J&J's pharmaceutical unit, which makes the cancer drug Darzalex, continued to post strong growth, which helped offset declines in its medical-device and consumer-health units.

In the same period a year earlier, the company's Covid-19 vaccine sales were $164 million. But the company also took a second-quarter charge of about $276 million for a reduction in research and manufacturing capacity for the shots, citing a global surplus of Covid-19 vaccine doses. The shot is one of four vaccines for Covid-19authorized or approved in the U.S., with Novavax Inc.'s vaccine most recently winning authorization. But use of the J&J shot in the U.S. has lagged behind that of vaccines developed by rival manufacturers Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.

About 17.1 million Americans have been vaccinated with J&J's single-dose shot, a fraction of the number who have been immunized with shots made by Moderna and by Pfizer and BioNTech SE, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those companies' booster shots have also seen far more use in the U.S. than J&J's. In the second quarter, J&J posted overall sales of $24 billion, compared with $23.3 billion a year earlier.

Johnson & Johnson,JNJ,2022/11/1,animal mistreatment,"Aerosol hair products tainted benzene store shelves
Valisure, an independent lab in New Haven, Conn., published a new analysis testing 148 batches of dry shampoo products from 34 different brands, and found that 70 percent contained benzene.
Butane is a petroleum-based propellant, and if it isn't refined well, there's a chance that the end product could contain traces of benzene, said Chris Cappa, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of California at Davis.
""Aerosol sprays appear to be one of the highest-risk categories for benzene contamination in consumer products,"" said David Light, the chief executive of Valisure, who also warned in May 2021 of benzene contamination in sunscreen products.
""We don't want to scare people into never using an aerosol can ever again, but it is a real risk."" In a statement announcing its recall of various dry shampoo products in October, Unilever said the company confirmed the propellant ""as the source"" of the benzene contamination.
The news that many of the favorite products we spray on our bodies might contain a cancer-causing contaminant has left some consumers concerned, prompting conversations on social media and online searches about benzene.
Some experts say the concern with any amount of benzene in consumer products, like dry shampoo or deodorant, is that we're often spraying these cans in enclosed spaces like small bathrooms where there's not a lot of air flow and a higher possibility of someone inhaling the known carcinogen.
""Any additional exposure you have from consumer products is going to increase your risk."" Contamination in the supply chain?Homer Swei, a senior vice president at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization, said he believes the supply chain of propellants for these different companies must have been affected to lead to such a wide range of recalls.
""They all have different supply chains."" The string of aerosol can recalls started after Valisure, the independent laboratory based in New Haven, Conn., published two separate studies detecting traces of benzene in dozens of different deodorant and sunscreen brands.
Other spray cans use a ""bag-on-valve"" technology that separates the propellant from the product inside the can, said Marisa Plescia, a cosmetic chemist based in Minneapolis.
Clues that a product may use an alternate technology such as the bag-on-valve system are claims that the product doesn't contain flammable ingredients or has a ""continuous spray."" Kelly Dobos, a cosmetic chemist and professor at the University of Cincinnati, said if companies decide to change aerosol technologies, it will take time to adjust formulations or develop new products with a different spraying system.
""While the levels of benzene found in the products from the Unilever recall are not expected to cause adverse health consequences, the best advice I can give to consumers who are concerned is to eliminate aerosol usage."" Swei said he would also tell his friends to avoid using these aerosol products ""until the industry can fix these problems in the supply chain."" ""While there's some uncertainty, it's not good for you,"" Swei said.","Aerosolized beauty products are popular and convenient, allowing us to spray our hair, faces and bodies with fine mists of deodorant, sunscreen and dry shampoo. But in the past 18 months, several major consumer products companies, including Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, have announced at least 10 recalls of well-known aerosol brands. The reason: The products contained elevated amounts of benzene, a chemical known to cause cancer and compromise our immune system. It's not clear how widespread the problem is, and the major companies involved have refused to answer questions or provide additional details. The affected aerosol products include some of the world's biggest brand names including certain lots of Neutrogena, Aveeno, Banana Boat and Coppertone sunscreens; Sure, Brut, Suave, Secret and Old Spice deodorants; Dove, Nexxus, Suave, TRESemmÃ© and Bed Head dry shampoos, and Tinactin and Odor Eaters foot sprays. In October, the news got worse. Valisure, an independent lab in New Haven, Conn., published a new analysis testing 148 batches of dry shampoo products from 34 different brands, and found that 70 percent contained benzene. The highest level of benzene detected was 340 parts per million in 10 seconds of spray. By comparison the Food and Drug Administration has said that the acceptable level of benzene in a drug is two parts per million. A problem with the propellantThe issue appears to be related mostly to butane-powered propellants that create pressure inside an aerosol can, which is what ultimately allows us to spray a fine mist of the product when we press the nozzle. Butane is a petroleum-based propellant, and if it isn't refined well, there's a chance that the end product could contain traces of benzene, said Chris Cappa, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of California at Davis. ""Aerosol sprays appear to be one of the highest-risk categories for benzene contamination in consumer products,"" said David Light, the chief executive of Valisure, who also warned in May 2021 of benzene contamination in sunscreen products. ""We don't want to scare people into never using an aerosol can ever again, but it is a real risk."" In a statement announcing its recall of various dry shampoo products in October, Unilever said the company confirmed the propellant ""as the source"" of the benzene contamination. Johnson & Johnson also said the contamination was related to the propellant, and said it has adopted new practices ""to prevent such an occurrence in the future,"" a spokesman said. A spokesperson for Procter & Gamble said the company has ""nothing to share"" about the recalls. The news that many of the favorite products we spray on our bodies might contain a cancer-causing contaminant has left some consumers concerned, prompting conversations on social media and online searches about benzene. When Kyla Moore, 22, who lives in Alberta, Canada, and works in customer relations, heard about the recall, she discovered her can of Dove coconut dry shampoo was on the list of potentially tainted products. She threw it in the trash a few days after Unilever's announcement, and said she doesn't plan to buy it again after switching to a new shampoo she likes better. The brands with the highest levels of benzene in the newest round of tests include Not Your Mother's, Sun Bum, Paul Mitchell, dp Hue and Sebastian, none of which have been recalled. In a statement, Not Your Mother's said the report ""is inconsistent with the data provided by our suppliers and the rigorous ongoing testing to ensure the safety and integrity of our products. These tests show no traceable amounts of benzene."" Trace amounts of benzene can add upBenzene is used to make plastics, detergents, dyes and pesticides. Breathing or otherwise absorbing benzene over time can lead to leukemia, anemia and other blood disorders, according to the FDA. Much of the research on the harmful effects of benzene focuses on occupational hazards. One study published in 1977 found workers in the U.S. rubber industry were at least five times more likely to develop leukemia. We can be exposed to benzene in many ways. Rubber collars were added to gas pump nozzles to protect us from the benzene in gas fumes. We inhale benzene when we smoke tobacco and expose our families to benzene through second hand smoke. In a study published earlier this month, researchers found benzene leaking from gas stoves in California. ""Everyone is exposed to benzene,"" said Stephen M. Rappaport, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. ""It's just a question of how much."" The World Health Organization has said ""there's no safe level"" of exposure to benzene in the air we breathe. Some experts say the concern with any amount of benzene in consumer products, like dry shampoo or deodorant, is that we're often spraying these cans in enclosed spaces like small bathrooms where there's not a lot of air flow and a higher possibility of someone inhaling the known carcinogen. Last week, Stella Krause, a 20-year-old undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, learned about the recall on Twitter. Instead of giving up her Dove dry shampoo, she started spraying it on her hair outside. Krause said she already thought breathing in dry shampoo spray wasn't good for her lungs. ""For carcinogens, it's not like there's some safe level,"" said Deborah Bennett, a professor of public health at the University of California at Davis. ""Any additional exposure you have from consumer products is going to increase your risk."" Contamination in the supply chain?Homer Swei, a senior vice president at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization, said he believes the supply chain of propellants for these different companies must have been affected to lead to such a wide range of recalls. Swei said the good news is ""the process is working"" and companies are trying to understand the cause. The bad news is there appears to be problems with more than one supplier. ""It hit everybody, it seems, at the same time, which is very strange,"" said Swei, who worked at Johnson & Johnson for nearly twenty years. ""They all have different supply chains."" The string of aerosol can recalls started after Valisure, the independent laboratory based in New Haven, Conn., published two separate studies detecting traces of benzene in dozens of different deodorant and sunscreen brands. Alternatives to aerosolsThis isn't the first time questions have been raised over the propellant used in our spray cans. For years, aerosol cans were propelled by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). But in the 1970s, researchers found CFCs are partially responsible for destroying the Earth's ozone layer, and companies stopped using them and eventually switched to other aerosol technologies, including butane-based propellants. But not all spray cans rely on petroleum-based propellants. Cans of whipped cream are often powered by nitrous oxide. Other spray cans use a ""bag-on-valve"" technology that separates the propellant from the product inside the can, said Marisa Plescia, a cosmetic chemist based in Minneapolis. To find out if your product contains a butane-powered propellant, just check the label. The chemicals used in the propellant should be listed in the ingredients or inactive ingredients box. Look for any ingredients that end in ""-ane,"" such as propane, butane and isobutane, Plescia said. Clues that a product may use an alternate technology such as the bag-on-valve system are claims that the product doesn't contain flammable ingredients or has a ""continuous spray."" Kelly Dobos, a cosmetic chemist and professor at the University of Cincinnati, said if companies decide to change aerosol technologies, it will take time to adjust formulations or develop new products with a different spraying system. ""Product development timelines are often a year, two years or more to account for testing and proving shelf life stability,"" Dobos said. ""While the levels of benzene found in the products from the Unilever recall are not expected to cause adverse health consequences, the best advice I can give to consumers who are concerned is to eliminate aerosol usage."" Swei said he would also tell his friends to avoid using these aerosol products ""until the industry can fix these problems in the supply chain."" ""While there's some uncertainty, it's not good for you,"" Swei said. ""The lower the better for known carcinogens. But, what that level is?

""While there's some uncertainty, it's not good for you,"" Swei said.","Aerosolized beauty products are popular and convenient, allowing us to spray our hair, faces and bodies with fine mists of deodorant, sunscreen and dry shampoo. But in the past 18 months, several major consumer products companies, including Unilever, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, have announced at least 10 recalls of well-known aerosol brands. The reason: The products contained elevated amounts of benzene, a chemical known to cause cancer and compromise our immune system. It's not clear how widespread the problem is, and the major companies involved have refused to answer questions or provide additional details. The affected aerosol products include some of the world's biggest brand names including certain lots of Neutrogena, Aveeno, Banana Boat and Coppertone sunscreens; Sure, Brut, Suave, Secret and Old Spice deodorants; Dove, Nexxus, Suave, TRESemmÃ© and Bed Head dry shampoos, and Tinactin and Odor Eaters foot sprays. In October, the news got worse. Valisure, an independent lab in New Haven, Conn., published a new analysis testing 148 batches of dry shampoo products from 34 different brands, and found that 70 percent contained benzene. The highest level of benzene detected was 340 parts per million in 10 seconds of spray. By comparison the Food and Drug Administration has said that the acceptable level of benzene in a drug is two parts per million. A problem with the propellantThe issue appears to be related mostly to butane-powered propellants that create pressure inside an aerosol can, which is what ultimately allows us to spray a fine mist of the product when we press the nozzle. Butane is a petroleum-based propellant, and if it isn't refined well, there's a chance that the end product could contain traces of benzene, said Chris Cappa, a professor of environmental engineering at the University of California at Davis. ""Aerosol sprays appear to be one of the highest-risk categories for benzene contamination in consumer products,"" said David Light, the chief executive of Valisure, who also warned in May 2021 of benzene contamination in sunscreen products. ""We don't want to scare people into never using an aerosol can ever again, but it is a real risk."" In a statement announcing its recall of various dry shampoo products in October, Unilever said the company confirmed the propellant ""as the source"" of the benzene contamination. Johnson & Johnson also said the contamination was related to the propellant, and said it has adopted new practices ""to prevent such an occurrence in the future,"" a spokesman said. A spokesperson for Procter & Gamble said the company has ""nothing to share"" about the recalls. The news that many of the favorite products we spray on our bodies might contain a cancer-causing contaminant has left some consumers concerned, prompting conversations on social media and online searches about benzene. When Kyla Moore, 22, who lives in Alberta, Canada, and works in customer relations, heard about the recall, she discovered her can of Dove coconut dry shampoo was on the list of potentially tainted products. She threw it in the trash a few days after Unilever's announcement, and said she doesn't plan to buy it again after switching to a new shampoo she likes better. The brands with the highest levels of benzene in the newest round of tests include Not Your Mother's, Sun Bum, Paul Mitchell, dp Hue and Sebastian, none of which have been recalled. In a statement, Not Your Mother's said the report ""is inconsistent with the data provided by our suppliers and the rigorous ongoing testing to ensure the safety and integrity of our products. These tests show no traceable amounts of benzene."" Trace amounts of benzene can add upBenzene is used to make plastics, detergents, dyes and pesticides. Breathing or otherwise absorbing benzene over time can lead to leukemia, anemia and other blood disorders, according to the FDA. Much of the research on the harmful effects of benzene focuses on occupational hazards. One study published in 1977 found workers in the U.S. rubber industry were at least five times more likely to develop leukemia. We can be exposed to benzene in many ways. Rubber collars were added to gas pump nozzles to protect us from the benzene in gas fumes. We inhale benzene when we smoke tobacco and expose our families to benzene through second hand smoke. In a study published earlier this month, researchers found benzene leaking from gas stoves in California. ""Everyone is exposed to benzene,"" said Stephen M. Rappaport, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley School of Public Health. ""It's just a question of how much."" The World Health Organization has said ""there's no safe level"" of exposure to benzene in the air we breathe. Some experts say the concern with any amount of benzene in consumer products, like dry shampoo or deodorant, is that we're often spraying these cans in enclosed spaces like small bathrooms where there's not a lot of air flow and a higher possibility of someone inhaling the known carcinogen. Last week, Stella Krause, a 20-year-old undergraduate student at the University of Chicago, learned about the recall on Twitter. Instead of giving up her Dove dry shampoo, she started spraying it on her hair outside. Krause said she already thought breathing in dry shampoo spray wasn't good for her lungs. ""For carcinogens, it's not like there's some safe level,"" said Deborah Bennett, a professor of public health at the University of California at Davis. ""Any additional exposure you have from consumer products is going to increase your risk."" Contamination in the supply chain?Homer Swei, a senior vice president at the Environmental Working Group, a research and advocacy organization, said he believes the supply chain of propellants for these different companies must have been affected to lead to such a wide range of recalls. Swei said the good news is ""the process is working"" and companies are trying to understand the cause. The bad news is there appears to be problems with more than one supplier. ""It hit everybody, it seems, at the same time, which is very strange,"" said Swei, who worked at Johnson & Johnson for nearly twenty years. ""They all have different supply chains."" The string of aerosol can recalls started after Valisure, the independent laboratory based in New Haven, Conn., published two separate studies detecting traces of benzene in dozens of different deodorant and sunscreen brands. Alternatives to aerosolsThis isn't the first time questions have been raised over the propellant used in our spray cans. For years, aerosol cans were propelled by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). But in the 1970s, researchers found CFCs are partially responsible for destroying the Earth's ozone layer, and companies stopped using them and eventually switched to other aerosol technologies, including butane-based propellants. But not all spray cans rely on petroleum-based propellants. Cans of whipped cream are often powered by nitrous oxide. Other spray cans use a ""bag-on-valve"" technology that separates the propellant from the product inside the can, said Marisa Plescia, a cosmetic chemist based in Minneapolis. To find out if your product contains a butane-powered propellant, just check the label. The chemicals used in the propellant should be listed in the ingredients or inactive ingredients box. Look for any ingredients that end in ""-ane,"" such as propane, butane and isobutane, Plescia said. Clues that a product may use an alternate technology such as the bag-on-valve system are claims that the product doesn't contain flammable ingredients or has a ""continuous spray."" Kelly Dobos, a cosmetic chemist and professor at the University of Cincinnati, said if companies decide to change aerosol technologies, it will take time to adjust formulations or develop new products with a different spraying system. ""Product development timelines are often a year, two years or more to account for testing and proving shelf life stability,"" Dobos said. ""While the levels of benzene found in the products from the Unilever recall are not expected to cause adverse health consequences, the best advice I can give to consumers who are concerned is to eliminate aerosol usage."" Swei said he would also tell his friends to avoid using these aerosol products ""until the industry can fix these problems in the supply chain.""

JPMorgan Chase,JPM,2021/4/13,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, impacts on landscapes, land ecosystems, palm oil","Kristin Lemkau: J.P. Morgan's Plan Scale Wealth Management
JPMorgan Chase surprised many back in 2019 by tapping its chief marketing officer to lead a newly unified wealth management business.
But Kristin Lemkau says her career has always been guided by a piece of advice she received long ago: ""If you want a bigger job, make your own job bigger."" Speaking with Barron's Advisor from an office at a Chase bank branch near her home in Rye, N.Y., Lemkau explains how her revenue-focused marketing work prepared her to lead J.P. Morgan U.S. Wealth Management, which has 4,000 advisors and $630 billion of assets under management.
She makes the case that digital cross-selling can help double the number of bank customers who do business with the wealth management unit.
Where did you grow up and how did you get into the wealth management business?
I ended up at J.P. Morgan somewhat accidentally in 1998, at what they call heritage J.P. Morganâ€”pre-Chase merger, pre-Bank One mergerâ€”and I took the job because I wanted to walk to work.
I had been doing some work for Jamie (Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase), and Gordon Smith (CEO of the Consumer & Community Banking unit), and Mary Erdoes (CEO of the Asset & Wealth Management division), in late summer 2019 in my old job as CMO, to figure out how to grow the business.
Do you think anyone in the wealth management ranks was unhappy you were chosen to run the business since you don't come from that world?
And in my old job I helped write the plan for how they would grow this businessâ€”and they said, ""Well, OK, go do that."" Walk us through the rebranding, announced in October , in which the brokerage, branch-based advisors, and digital investment platforms were brought under the new J.P. Morgan Wealth Management brand.
Even if they invest with us in a Chase branch, what gets them over the line is the J.P. Morgan products and the research, and the J.P. Morgan advisor.
So we knew we had Chase Wealth Management, You Invest, J.P. Morgan Securities, and we were probably punching below our weight with all of these different fragments.
You have not publicly announced growth targets, but clearly they're ambitiousâ€”Jamie Dimon said in 2018 that the bank could double its wealth management market share .
Right now we've got the No. 1 wealth management app, according to J.D. Power, we have the No. 1 primary bank, we have the No. 1 online banking mobile app, and we're the fastest growing in deposits.
Whether it's a branch-based advisor, a J.P. Morgan advisor, a self-directed or robo client, and then as you know we're building out our hybrid advice component under Boaz Lahovitsky, who we hired from Vanguard about six months ago.
If we have 40 million people on the app and they're on it every day, why would they ever want to go invest, particularly for the first time, with somebody else, if we make it super easy for them to invest with us?
In terms of growth targets, we can share that we're aiming to double the number of Chase deposit clients that invest with J.P. Morgan Wealth Management.
(She declined to provide a timeframe.â€”Eds.) J.P. Morgan Wealth Management recently announced plans to hire 300 Black and Latinx advisors by 2025.
I'd say we've done a good job over the past three years of increasing our diversity pipeline within the branch-based advisors, and that was super intentional.
The first thing we did was create something called the Advisor Development Program, where we hire and develop diverse advisors with no former financial services experience through a three-year training, development, and support program.
And as you probably read, we will double down on both of those things as well as increase our pipeline from HBCUs and try some other paths to get more people to consider a career as an advisor.
I think if you go on campus and ask people, or if I ask my nephew's friends what they want to do, they'll say investment banking or they'll say consulting or they want to go work in a tech company.
We also have an internal training program for experienced advisors called the Advisor Growth Program, that's a two-to-three-year deep-training program around goals-based planning, where they come out with an internal certification as well as the WMCP (Wealth Management Certified Professional) designation, issued by the American College of Financial Services.
Start getting more into not just growing the money, but what they'll do with the money, particularly now because I think what's important to people has changed.
Kristin Lemkau: J.P. Morgan's Plan to Scale Up Wealth Management","JPMorgan Chase surprised many back in 2019 by tapping its chief marketing officer to lead a newly unified wealth management business. But Kristin Lemkau says her career has always been guided by a piece of advice she received long ago: ""If you want a bigger job, make your own job bigger."" Speaking with Barron's Advisor from an office at a Chase bank branch near her home in Rye, N.Y., Lemkau explains how her revenue-focused marketing work prepared her to lead J.P. Morgan U.S. Wealth Management, which has 4,000 advisors and $630 billion of assets under management. She makes the case that digital cross-selling can help double the number of bank customers who do business with the wealth management unit. And she explains why she doesn't shy away from weighing in on hot-button topics like racial justice and inequality on social media. Where did you grow up and how did you get into the wealth management business? I was born in Boston into a big Boston sports fan family. We moved to New Jersey when I was in fifth grade, but we went to Massachusetts every summer, so I still claim that I'm from New England. My father actually worked at Merrill Lynch for 25 years, but it wasn't anything that I ever thought I would get into. I majored in creative writing and thought I was going to, I don't know, change the world. I ended up at J.P. Morgan somewhat accidentally in 1998, at what they call heritage J.P. Morganâ€”pre-Chase merger, pre-Bank One mergerâ€”and I took the job because I wanted to walk to work. I figured I would work there for a few years, and 22 years later I'm now the CEO of what is potentially the biggest growth opportunity of the firm. What did your dad do at Merrill? He started out as a financial advisor. He ran different offices and then he ran the research department by the time he left. And then he worked at Prudential for I don't remember how long, maybe five or 10 years, and then he retired at Lord Abbett. He passed away seven and a half years ago but he would have been really proud. How did your transition from running marketing to running a business lineâ€”an unlikely trajectoryâ€”come about? Going from CMO to CEO was not impossible but certainly unorthodox. I had been doing some work for Jamie (Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase), and Gordon Smith (CEO of the Consumer & Community Banking unit), and Mary Erdoes (CEO of the Asset & Wealth Management division), in late summer 2019 in my old job as CMO, to figure out how to grow the business. And during the course of that work I think I realized, and maybe they realized, that I could do this job. Do you think anyone in the wealth management ranks was unhappy you were chosen to run the business since you don't come from that world? I don't knowâ€”you'll have to ask them. Hopefully they're happy now. Why do you think they gave you the opportunity? Hopefully, it's because of the way I ran marketing. Your job as a marketer is to grow the business, full stop. It's not to win awards, it's not to go to conferences; it's to be accountable for growth. I always held the marketing team accountable first for clear, revenue-driving metrics. Even if that budget and those metrics were owned by the business, we had to be able to measure our contribution to all that. I was very performance-marketing driven, particularly about growing our affluent market share. I helped launch the Sapphire Card. I helped launch Sapphire Banking. So we were deeply involved in product development. And in my old job I helped write the plan for how they would grow this businessâ€”and they said, ""Well, OK, go do that."" Walk us through the rebranding, announced in October , in which the brokerage, branch-based advisors, and digital investment platforms were brought under the new J.P. Morgan Wealth Management brand. All of the research pointed to the fact that the J.P. Morgan brand is a critical asset for us. It's the reason people trust us, and it's the reason people want to invest with us. Even if they invest with us in a Chase branch, what gets them over the line is the J.P. Morgan products and the research, and the J.P. Morgan advisor. So we knew we had Chase Wealth Management, You Invest, J.P. Morgan Securities, and we were probably punching below our weight with all of these different fragments. And we said, the best thing we can do is align it all under J.P. Morgan and put a lot of marketing heft behind that. You have not publicly announced growth targets, but clearly they're ambitiousâ€”Jamie Dimon said in 2018 that the bank could double its wealth management market share . What are the growth levers? I think the big opportunity for us is to convert the embedded base. Right now we've got the No. 1 wealth management app, according to J.D. Power, we have the No. 1 primary bank, we have the No. 1 online banking mobile app, and we're the fastest growing in deposits. So for us the core to that strategy is converting clientsâ€”mostly the deposit clients but also the lending clientsâ€”into investment clients. Doing that both in the physical branch and on the app because, yes, we want to compete with Morgan Stanley and Merrill and all of the traditional players, but we also want to compete with Fidelity and Schwab and Robinhood, and we likely have better distribution than all of them except for BofA. How can you increase cross-selling? I'll just take the branch-based business. Relationship building with the deposit-based client inside the branch is highly effective. Over 90% of our referrals come from the banker in the branch, and it's a partnership that nobody else has been able to replicate. The next step is having that same kind of success in a digital platform. We have 40 million people on the app. How do I get all those people engaged in experience? Whether it's a branch-based advisor, a J.P. Morgan advisor, a self-directed or robo client, and then as you know we're building out our hybrid advice component under Boaz Lahovitsky, who we hired from Vanguard about six months ago. What I think became super clear to all of us is that we weren't optimizing the digital experience. If we have 40 million people on the app and they're on it every day, why would they ever want to go invest, particularly for the first time, with somebody else, if we make it super easy for them to invest with us? Can you quantify how much you're aiming to grow? In terms of growth targets, we can share that we're aiming to double the number of Chase deposit clients that invest with J.P. Morgan Wealth Management. (She declined to provide a timeframe.â€”Eds.) J.P. Morgan Wealth Management recently announced plans to hire 300 Black and Latinx advisors by 2025. Where do you think the industry's diversity problems stem from? The industry's got two problems. They don't have enough diversity in their advisor ranks and theyâ€”weâ€”don't have enough diversity in our clients. As far as the advisors, I can't speak to where the industry went sideways but it is startling when you see the consistent lack of progress. I'd say we've done a good job over the past three years of increasing our diversity pipeline within the branch-based advisors, and that was super intentional. But we still have a ways to go. Can you quantify that? Fifty-one percent of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s U.S. employees are racially diverse, with 41% in midlevel manager positions, and 19% in senior or executive positions. Women represent 53% of the total workforce in the U.S., 42% are in middle-management positions, and 27% in senior level positions. We don't have a breakdown of representation numbers by line of business. What were the keys to improving advisor diversity, including adding more women, in the branches? The first thing we did was create something called the Advisor Development Program, where we hire and develop diverse advisors with no former financial services experience through a three-year training, development, and support program. The program started out in 2020. We now have almost 250 participants in the program, of which over 76% are diverse. The second thing we did was accelerate the number of bankers who get licensed and trained to become advisors, which is also a very diverse population and something that's unique to us. If you're a high-achieving banker and you've already got a partnership with the advisor, you know that branch ecosystem and operating model. The next step for you would be to apply to become an advisor. So that was actually a great source of talent for us as well. And as you probably read, we will double down on both of those things as well as increase our pipeline from HBCUs and try some other paths to get more people to consider a career as an advisor. I think if you go on campus and ask people, or if I ask my nephew's friends what they want to do, they'll say investment banking or they'll say consulting or they want to go work in a tech company. I haven't found one that said they wanted to be a financial advisor yet. The industry also has ground to make up with respect to female representation. In addition to the programs you just described, how are you trying to achieve that? We also have an internal training program for experienced advisors called the Advisor Growth Program, that's a two-to-three-year deep-training program around goals-based planning, where they come out with an internal certification as well as the WMCP (Wealth Management Certified Professional) designation, issued by the American College of Financial Services. We are making that available to our existing employees and we're encouraging diverse and female advisors to be in some of the earlier classes. You're one of the most prominent women on Wall Street. What's your advice for women about breaking through the industry's glass ceiling? At least in the business I'm in, women are running the place. So it doesn't feel like a glass ceiling. It felt a little different maybe 20 years ago but I honestly have never felt boxed out simply by being a woman. Work really, really hard, treat people well, surround yourself with amazing people who will tell you the truth, and you'll do well. And I'd say the same thing to men. I want to ask about your social media presence. On Twitter you've addressed some of the social problems and social movements the nation is experiencing nowâ€”gun violence, Black Lives Matter. As you know, a lot of people in the industry won't touch anything controversial or political in their posts. What are your thoughts about where to draw that line? I'm super clear, at least on my social media presence, that I speak for me. I do think people follow people, they don't follow brands as much. And I try my best to be my authentic, principled self. Where I try to be vocal about issues, I appreciate that there are other sides of it, but I think things like racial justice, racial equality, being against gun violence are things that most people agree with. Among those who work for you, how much latitude do you give to express personal views on social media? I'm OK with people authentically being themselves. I get that it gets tricky and that some issues may seem politicized whether they should be politicized or not. But I want principled people to work for me, and I understand that self-expression is part of being principled. Name a great piece of career advice you've received. If you want a bigger job, make your own job bigger. That's served me well in that I didn't always have respect for the boundaries of my job. I would just do stuff if somebody asked me to do it. Then people think of you as the person in the next job before you even get there. I tell people all the time, ""Don't wait for somebody to come get you, own it."" What's an actionable idea more advisors should be implementing? I think it's to ask clients, ""What are the top things that matter most to you about your financial life?"" and ask them not just about the financial goal, but what they want to do with that financial goal. Start getting more into not just growing the money, but what they'll do with the money, particularly now because I think what's important to people has changed. So even if a client said it's retirement or it's a second house, they may have completely reoriented that, having gone through what everybody has gone through. How do you relax and recharge? I have enjoyed giving myself permission to waste time during all of this. I didn't realize how tightly wound I was about how I spent my time, including the weekends. I was like, ""I'm going to nap, then I'm going to work out, then I'm going to my son's game."" And just letting myself go watch two dumb, old movies has been really liberating. Thanks, Kristin.

JPMorgan Chase Chief Jamie Dimon isn't so sure. Dimon, speaking at a Morgan Stanley conference Monday, said he expects to see higher rates and more inflation. To prepare, he's keeping a little extra cash on the balance sheet. About $500 billion. ""Our balance sheet is positioned and will benefit from rising rates,"" Dimon said. It's not a popular call. A recent Bank of America survey found two-thirds of fund managers believe inflation is only transitoryâ€”just a function of higher commodity prices, which are destined to fall as global production returns to prepandemic norms. But a little inflation can go a long way. It could force interest rates to rise, pushing down bond prices, and it can also push down stock prices. Don't forget the February tech tantrum. A small rise in bond yields sent the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory, down almost 13% from prior highs. The Nasdaq, which hit an all-time high Monday, has recovered all of those losses, a sign that inflation concerns have dissipated. Yet just because the market has stopped worrying doesn't mean inflation won't be a problem. It might not be transitory if labor rates rise or if production has trouble ramping up to meet strong postpandemic demand. That's what Dimon is betting his balance sheet on. â€”Al Root *** The Biden administration is proposing some unprecedented changes to the tax code.

In Scotland, researchers estimated the risk of hospitalization with Delta was reduced by around 70% after two doses of either. * On Monday, Novavax said its vaccine was 90.4% effective overall and 100% effective in protecting against moderate and severe illness in Phase 3 trials of nearly 30,000 adults in the U.S. and Mexico. * Novavax's success rate is nearly as high as Pfizer-BioNTech's 95% and Moderna's 94%, and better than Johnson & Johnson's 66%. * Restrictions are lifting in more places as U.S. public health officials race to meet a July 4 deadline to get 70% of the adult population partially vaccinated.

JPMorgan Chase,JPM,2021/6/21,"fraud, violation of national legislation","Jamie Dimon insists workers return office â€?hereâ€™s thatâ€™s bit rich
In a memo signed by Dimon and sent to employees this week, the company said that it was mandatory for all employees to disclose their COVID-19 vaccination status by June 30, and that employees should return to the office by July 6.
Employees, meanwhile, may feel like theyâ€™ve been given a proverbial puppy of remote work â€?as well as perhaps adopting a real one during the pandemic â€?only to have it taken suddenly away.
Some employees will work five days a week on site; others will spend a minimum of 50% of their time in the office due to occupancy limits.
â€œWe are aware that some teams are piloting a hybrid approach that varies by job, such as three days in the office or 50% rotations, but we want each of you back regularly so that we can test the effectiveness of these models as quickly as possible,â€?the memo said.
But insisting people return to the office â€?so bluntly and so soon, with the U.S.â€™s adult vaccination rate having only in late May crossed the 50% threshold â€?arguably only threatens to exacerbate that gap.
â€œIf you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office,â€?Dimonâ€™s fellow banking CEO, James Gorman of Morgan Stanley, who was paid $33 million last year, told a company conference this month.
Morgan Stanley MS employees, in one significant difference from their peers at JPMorgan, will need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before they can return to offices in New York.
A Goldman Sachs memo released last month, co-signed by CEO David Solomon, said: â€œWe are focused on progressing on our journey to gradually bring our people back together again, where it is safe to do so.â€?Not all nine-to-five employees enjoy the same luxuries and carefree domestic lifestyles as CEOs. Itâ€™s a daily juggle and struggle.
How can we create companies that are great places for single parents to work, or people who are caring for other family members, or people with health conditions or impairments?â€?â€œThe question I always get is, â€˜What happens to those jobs?â€?The obvious answer is remote workers still buy coffee, we still go to restaurants â€?if anything, we actually do that more,â€?Herd said.
Rather than do it at the bottom of some faceless high-rise in New York, we buy it from people locally.â€?The one reason employers are reluctant to allow people to work from home, even for a portion of the week, often comes down to trust.
â€œItâ€™s the louder, more gregarious people who benefited disproportionately from the office,â€?Herd said.
Remote work can be great for many people.â€?There are many questions that need to be answered about remote or virtual work.
As Joseph Davis, Vanguardâ€™s global chief economist, asked last December: â€œIf tech workers can just as easily do their jobs from home offices in Toledo or Tulsa or Topeka, do Silicon Valley firms need vast California campuses?â€?There is much to be said in favor of real-time work and interaction.
As the JPMorgan memo pointed out, working virtually is easier when people have established relationships, but remote work makes it harder to train new employees and develop new relationships.
But Dimon did not help the cause with his inflammatory comments last month: â€œAnd yes, the commute, you know, yes, people donâ€™t like commuting, but so what?â€?He is not, after all, sitting on the Long Island Railroad or Amtrak for an hour or two, each way.
To be clear, people were forced to work from home during the pandemic, juggling other responsibilities like childcare and homeschooling.","The Moneyist: â€˜JPMorgan is playing a zero-sum game with its staff: Theyâ€™re either all in, or theyâ€™re all outâ€?MarketWatch illustration/Terrence HoranItâ€™s time to hire a dog walker, and ditch the Lululemon LULU sweats. Thatâ€™s the message JPMorgan Chaseâ€™s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has sent employees. In a memo signed by Dimon and sent to employees this week, the company said that it was mandatory for all employees to disclose their COVID-19 vaccination status by June 30, and that employees should return to the office by July 6. Those who are unvaccinated or choose not to answer the vaccination question will have to wear a mask, adhere to social-distancing guidelines and get tested for COVID-19 weekly. Along with Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs GS, JPMorgan wants workers to prepare to return to their desks this summer. Employees, meanwhile, may feel like theyâ€™ve been given a proverbial puppy of remote work â€?as well as perhaps adopting a real one during the pandemic â€?only to have it taken suddenly away. Dimon did not mince his words. Working from home â€œdoesnâ€™t work for people who want to hustle, doesnâ€™t work for culture, doesnâ€™t work for idea generation. By September it will look just like it did before,â€?Dimon said at a Wall Street Journal CEO Council event last month. â€œWe are getting blowback about coming back internally, but thatâ€™s life.â€?The company has called for a minimum of 50% occupancy, and in some cases 100% occupancy, depending on the department and the roles involved. JPMorgan is playing a zero-sum game with its staff: Theyâ€™re either all in, or theyâ€™re all out. When asked â€?yes, it doesnâ€™t hurt to ask â€?most employees recognize the importance of being present to brainstorm with colleagues and form creative teams, but they also overwhelmingly prefer some kind of hybrid format. Millions of people thank their lucky stars that they still have a job, and couldnâ€™t care less whether they do it in person or remotely, in their pajamas or chinos and a blue shirt. But the radical change of scenery over the last 16 months has also led people to re-evaluate the cost of childcare, their work-life balance and their career aspirations. There is more understanding and nuance in JPMorganâ€™s back-to-the-office memo that was missing from Dimonâ€™s more provocative proclamations. Some employees will work five days a week on site; others will spend a minimum of 50% of their time in the office due to occupancy limits. â€œWe are aware that some teams are piloting a hybrid approach that varies by job, such as three days in the office or 50% rotations, but we want each of you back regularly so that we can test the effectiveness of these models as quickly as possible,â€?the memo said. This conversation is so much bigger than JPMorgan. But the biggest U.S. bank provides as useful an entry point as any corporation. Not everyone can afford to live in places like New York City, where JPMorgan JPM is headquartered, or Seattle or Los Angeles, or many of the major U.S. corporate hubs. Dimon, after all, received a compensation package of $31.66 million last year, up from $31.61 million in 2019. Heâ€™s well remunerated and in a privileged position, even more so than most of those who have the option to work from home. When the stationery cupboard is bare, no one will ask him if they can borrow his stapler. Getty ImagesRacial wealth gap Dimon has stressed the importance of coping with the U.S.â€™s racial wealth gap, and he has pledged to address working conditions and burnout in the bankâ€™s ranks. But insisting people return to the office â€?so bluntly and so soon, with the U.S.â€™s adult vaccination rate having only in late May crossed the 50% threshold â€?arguably only threatens to exacerbate that gap. About that racial wealth gap. Remote work raises questions about public health and work-life-balance issues, but finances determine where people can live and work. The millions of job losses at the peak of COVID-19 pandemic hit Black and Hispanic Americans more than white Americans, research shows. Their work was also less likely to be virtual, or mobile. Whatâ€™s more, those who had to travel to their place of work reported a greater deterioration in working conditions. Opening up more locations for employees also opens companies up to more diverse applicants. â€œIf you can go into a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office,â€?Dimonâ€™s fellow banking CEO, James Gorman of Morgan Stanley, who was paid $33 million last year, told a company conference this month. That headline-grabbing quote aside, Gorman also said that more junior employees learn in the office. Last week, he told CNBC that he himself started off with two to three days a week on site, and gradually upped it to three or four. But he also said that New York jobs come with New York salaries. Morgan Stanley MS employees, in one significant difference from their peers at JPMorgan, will need to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 before they can return to offices in New York. All staff are required to attest their vaccination status by July 1. A Goldman Sachs memo released last month, co-signed by CEO David Solomon, said: â€œWe are focused on progressing on our journey to gradually bring our people back together again, where it is safe to do so.â€?Not all nine-to-five employees enjoy the same luxuries and carefree domestic lifestyles as CEOs. Itâ€™s a daily juggle and struggle. Escaping to the suburbs can save families hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime. The median cost of a home in New York City hovers at $675,545, according to Zillow ZG. Americaâ€™s greatest cities will never be easy or inexpensive places to live. After a pandemic-related great migration out of urban centers, the median sale price of homes in cities was up 16% in February on a year-over-year basis, surpassing the price increases in the suburbs for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, Redfin said in March. Mark Wilson/Getty ImagesWorkplace revolution Do we have the next workplace revolution within our grasp, one that perhaps rivals the industrial revolution and the digital revolution? Is this the next natural, if not inevitable, step? Chris Herd, the founder and CEO of Firstbase, which helps companies transition to remote work, said he thinks so. Or would like it to be so. He said he prefers the term â€œwork communitiesâ€?over â€œcorporate culture,â€?a concept often used to herd the army of clockwatchers back to the mothership. When I asked Herd about the ability to cast the hiring net wider and recruit a more diverse workforce during an interview on Barronâ€™s Live last week, he said: â€œWhat weâ€™re talking about is enabling access to opportunity to everyone. How can we create companies that are great places for single parents to work, or people who are caring for other family members, or people with health conditions or impairments?â€?â€œThe question I always get is, â€˜What happens to those jobs?â€?The obvious answer is remote workers still buy coffee, we still go to restaurants â€?if anything, we actually do that more,â€?Herd said. â€œWe just do it locally. Rather than do it at the bottom of some faceless high-rise in New York, we buy it from people locally.â€?The one reason employers are reluctant to allow people to work from home, even for a portion of the week, often comes down to trust. It needs to be tested in order to be proven wrong. Has the pandemic â€?for better or for worse â€?not already achieved that? The jury is out on how many lightbulb moments take place during long conference-room meetings or chance encounters while rummaging for your packed lunch in the office refrigerator â€?assuming last nightâ€™s tofu curry has not already been snaffled by an anonymous coworker. In fact, when companies switched to open-plan offices â€?presumably designed without increased demand for noise-canceling earphones in mind â€?researchers reported in Harvard Business Review that face-to-face interactions actually fell by 70%. Herd, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not swayed by the argument that businesses will pay a price for all those lost moments of brainstorming by the office water cooler. He calls offices â€œinstantaneous gratification distraction factoriesâ€?where synchronous work is impractical and, in fact, often make it impossible to get stuff done. Mandel Ngan/Agence France-Presse/Getty ImagesPostprandial dip And then thereâ€™s the notorious postprandial dip, easily solved at home by a 20-minute nap on the sofa followed by a brisk constitutional in the local park. A paper in the Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine has this to say about that midafternoon productivity black hole. â€œThe post-lunch dip is a real phenomenon that can occur even when the individual has had no lunch and is unaware of the time of day,â€?the researchers concluded. â€œThis dip has its roots in human biology, and may be linked to the size of the 12-hour harmonic in the circadian system. It is certainly exacerbated by a high-carbohydrate lunch, and may be more likely to occur in extreme morning-type individuals.â€?So who gets ahead in Americaâ€™s corporate culture? Who are all of those open-plan offices and transparent glass conference-room walls built for? â€œItâ€™s the louder, more gregarious people who benefited disproportionately from the office,â€?Herd said. â€œThey would go into meetings and share their views in a more forthright way than other people would,â€?he added. â€œThe office has been great for a few people. Remote work can be great for many people.â€?There are many questions that need to be answered about remote or virtual work. But we also shouldnâ€™t forget that itâ€™s a privilege not afforded to most frontline workers in hospitals, in the service industry, in retail and, yes, at the bank branch. They should be both appreciated and applauded. But there is momentum for a different approach to work that can be done remotely. As Joseph Davis, Vanguardâ€™s global chief economist, asked last December: â€œIf tech workers can just as easily do their jobs from home offices in Toledo or Tulsa or Topeka, do Silicon Valley firms need vast California campuses?â€?There is much to be said in favor of real-time work and interaction. As the JPMorgan memo pointed out, working virtually is easier when people have established relationships, but remote work makes it harder to train new employees and develop new relationships. â€œA heavy reliance on Zoom meetings actually slows down decision making because there is little immediate follow-up,â€?the companyâ€™s memo added. Real-time work occupies a fertile and critical place in our work lives. But Dimon did not help the cause with his inflammatory comments last month: â€œAnd yes, the commute, you know, yes, people donâ€™t like commuting, but so what?â€?He is not, after all, sitting on the Long Island Railroad or Amtrak for an hour or two, each way. To be clear, people were forced to work from home during the pandemic, juggling other responsibilities like childcare and homeschooling. But imagine a true virtual work life, with time to run a duster over the house, be home for the cable guy, while using that valuable commuting time to make an early start to the work day. That flexibility would give people room to breathe and, arguably, become more productive by using their time more efficiently. Maybe then weâ€™d get closer to a healthier office idyll of learning, networking and brainstorming. People would show up because they want to, and not because they were strong-armed into it. No more staring at an office computer screen wishing you were home with your dog, wondering if the air conditioner really does crank up after three oâ€™clock. No more being tasked with the job of ordering stationery. And no more politicking, world-weary coworkers making you wish youâ€™d bought those discounted noise-canceling headphones on Amazon Prime DayAMZN when you had the chance.","<Incident Category>: fraud, violation of national legislation

The acquisition is expected to be completed in the first half of next year, subject to regulatory approvals. Volkswagen's payments business, founded in Luxembourg in 2017, operates in 32 markets around the world and offers a range of digital payment services. It allows customers to buy cars or take out leases, pay for parking as well as fuel and electric-vehicle charging, make in-vehicle payments, and purchase subscriptions like insurance and in-car entertainment. It's an increasingly important part of the auto sector, with the in-vehicle payment market alone expected to reach $4 billion in 2021, according to market research group Grand View. Volkswagen is the world's second-largest auto maker. Its brands include its namesake as well as Audi, Porsche, Bentley, and Lamborghini.

JPMorgan Chase,JPM,2021/9/24,"fraud, violation of national legislation","EXCLUSIVE-JPMorgan's Dimon cautions U.S. default 'potentially catastrophic'
(Adds latest on debt talks) By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has begun preparing for the possibility of the United States hitting its debt limit, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters on Tuesday, adding he nevertheless expected policymakers to find a solution to avoid that ""potentially catastrophic"" event.
The country's largest lender has begun scenario-planning for how a potential U.S. credit default would affect the repo and money markets, client contracts, its capital ratios, and how ratings agencies would react, Dimon said in an interview.
""This is like the third time we've had to do this, it is a potentially catastrophic event,"" he said.
Dimon said as part of its preparation the bank was combing through its client-contracts, a resource-intensive process.
RACIAL EQUITY Dimon was speaking to Reuters before a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the bank's new branch in southeast Washington, part of JPMorgan's effort to promote racial equity by boosting its presence in underserved communities.
""It's not a traditional bank branch, we want it to be very welcoming, we want it to be attractive,"" said Dimon.","(Adds latest on debt talks) By Pete Schroeder WASHINGTON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has begun preparing for the possibility of the United States hitting its debt limit, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told Reuters on Tuesday, adding he nevertheless expected policymakers to find a solution to avoid that ""potentially catastrophic"" event. The country's largest lender has begun scenario-planning for how a potential U.S. credit default would affect the repo and money markets, client contracts, its capital ratios, and how ratings agencies would react, Dimon said in an interview. ""This is like the third time we've had to do this, it is a potentially catastrophic event,"" he said. ""Every single time this comes up, it gets fixed, but we should never even get this close. I just think this whole thing is mistaken and one day we should just have a bipartisan bill and get rid of the debt ceiling. It's all politics,"" he added. Congressional Democrats are scrambling to find a way to raise the government's $28.4-trillion borrowing cap before the Treasury Department runs out of means to service the nation's debt. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has said the Treasury will likely exhaust extraordinary measures by Oct. 18. Democrats have prepared votes to head off a government shutdown and a potentially economically-crippling U.S. credit default on Tuesday, but a quick resolution appeared unlikely in the face of continued Republican resistance. Fiscal brinkmanship has become a regular feature of U.S. politics over the past decade thanks to ongoing partisan polarization, with debt ceiling deals coming down to the wire in 2011 and 2017. Bloomberg reported last week that Secretary Yellen had called the leaders of the biggest Wall Street financial firms to recruit them in her campaign to pressure Republicans to agree to a deal. The Treasury declined to comment on the report. Dimon said as part of its preparation the bank was combing through its client-contracts, a resource-intensive process. ""You've got to check the contracts to try to predict it out ... If I remember correctly, the last time we got prepared for this, it cost us $100 million,"" he said. RACIAL EQUITY Dimon was speaking to Reuters before a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the bank's new branch in southeast Washington, part of JPMorgan's effort to promote racial equity by boosting its presence in underserved communities. The branch is the eleventh of its kind JPMorgan has opened in cities including New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Chicago, since 2019. As well as providing traditional services, the branches work with local community groups to provide free skills training and other small-business support. ""It's not a traditional bank branch, we want it to be very welcoming, we want it to be attractive,"" said Dimon. Following nationwide ""Black Lives Matter"" protests last year, JPMorgan pledged $30 billion over five years to advance racial equity. That includes originating 40,000 new mortgages and 15,000 small business loans to Black and Latino communities. The investment underscores how large corporations are increasingly embracing social, environmental and governance or ESG issues amid pressure from investors. Addressing racial equity is also a priority for President Joe Biden's administration which has said bank branch ""deserts"" perpetuate inequality by reducing access to credit. Biden's acting Comptroller of the Currency Michael Hsu this month said he would scrap contentious changes to fair lending laws led by his Trump-appointed predecessor and start a fresh review with other banking regulators. Rules around the Community Reinvestment Act, where regulators score banks on how well they serve poor communities, need to be regularly modernized to account for technology-driven changes in banking, said Dimon, who said the overall law is good for the country. ""It is very complicated, very slow, very late, very hard to measure,"" he said, adding CRA assessments should also be performed in real time, as opposed to a retrospective review every few years. ""Does it actually capture everything? No. Is it real time? No. Is it politicized? Absolutely.""

They found it tucked away in a tiny corner of JPMorgan Chase & Co. A few dozen employees at the JPMorgan Chase Institute, the bank's in-house think tank, have unparalleled access to the saving, spending and borrowing habits of the bank's customers, stripped of names and other identifying details. The Federal Reserve has used the Institute's research when weighing interest-rate decisions, according to people familiar with the matter. Institute researchers meet with Biden administration economists monthly, some of the people said, and helped measure the costs and benefits of dueling student-loan forgiveness plans. Economists studying U.S. consumers have plenty of data at their disposal, but nothing quite like what they can get from America's biggest bank. Peering into JPMorgan bank and credit-card accounts, researchers can match up inflowsâ€”paychecks, unemployment benefitsâ€”with outflows. That isn't possible with the government's broad unemployment and consumer-spending surveys. Chris Wheat and Fiona Greig at their offices in Washington last week.

The group's researchers cited the Institute's consumer-spending and unemployment data in papers on the pandemic's effects. JPMorgan is now using the data to shape economic policy. The bank recently paired the Institute with its PolicyCenter, created in 2019 to advocate for nonpartisan, data-driven ideas. (The PolicyCenter is separate from the bank's government-relations team, which lobbies for policies that benefit JPMorgan.) The Institute is run by two economists: Fiona Greig, a public-policy expert, and Chris Wheat, a data scientist. They report to Heather Higginbottom, a former Obama administration official who heads the bank's research and policy groups, as well as its philanthropic efforts. JPMorgan Chase offices in Washington. PHOTO: Stephen Voss for The Wall Street Journal What is good for the U.S. economy is good for JPMorgan. Banks prosper when businesses and consumers are healthy enough to spend and borrow. But executives say the Institute and policy groups have a broader aim: to deliver Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's vision of government policy tethered to measurable outcomes. ""Two of the north stars guiding us at this moment are how do we drive an inclusive recovery and how do we close the racial wealth gap,"" said Ms. Greig. JPMorgan launched the Institute in 2015. Big Data was booming, but banks had yet to embrace the notion of turning their data into a public resource. That summer, the Fed was debating raising interest rates for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis sent them close to zero. Gasoline prices were plunging, but the central bank and other economists didn't have a clear understanding of what consumers were doing with the money they were saving. The answer would shed light on the state of consumer confidence. ""It's a little bit of a mystery,"" then-Chairman Janet Yellen said at a Fed board meeting. The Institute tallied customer gas spending to show the savings in aggregate and mapped where that money was going. They found consumers were spending about 80% of their savings, more than surveys had shown. The Fed raised interest rates in December. The Institute's early work helped lead to changes inside JPMorgan. The bank launched an automatic saving program to encourage customers to put aside more money for rainy days. It cut health-insurance deductibles for Chase employees making less than $60,000 a year after an Institute report showed unexpected medical costs could set back a family's savings by 12 months. A study of racial disparities in consumer finance informed the bank's $30 billion push to help close the racial wealth gap. Then came a pandemic that put millions of Americans out of work in a matter of days. The economy ground to a halt and Institute researchers watched spending on JPMorgan credit cards plunge across all income levels. At the same time, bank-account balances began to riseâ€”particularly among lower-income households. The swings were so enormous that Institute researchers wondered if there was a glitch in the data. 'There is a desire for businesses to get more socially involved,' Heather Higginbottom said. PHOTO: Stephen Voss for The Wall Street Journal Brad McConnell, chief executive of Allies for Community Business in Chicago, asked the Institute for help targeting small-business aid during the lockdowns. JPMorgan supplied a breakdown of cash balances at small businesses by ZIP Code in Chicago and other cities, something Mr. McConnell had never seen. ""It was a point of emphasis on our team to make sure we were dedicating additional time to the neighborhoods that data showed us,"" Mr. McConnell said. His group delivered $400 million in small-business emergency loans and grants in 2020, compared with just $4 million in 2019. Mr. Dimon used Institute data when he traveled to Washington in the fall of 2020 to persuade Trump administration officials the economy needed a second round of stimulus. Consumers who had built savings during the first round of payments had spent them, the data showed. After the election, Ms. Higginbottom's group sent a paper to the Biden transition team with a series of policy suggestions, a first for the bank. It promoted the earned-income tax credit and pushed for more stimulus and student-loan forbearance. Baby bonds, government grants given to children at birth, and expanded job options for people with criminal records would reduce racial wealth disparities, the paper suggested. ""There is a desire for businesses to get more socially involved,"" said Ms. Higginbottom. ""We are doing it with data.""

United Airlines Holdings Inc. in recent weeks said it would allow back unvaccinated employees who got religious or medical exemptions from the company's Covid-19 vaccine mandate.
Many human-resources executives say they updated their company's protocols in response to a loosening of mask and vaccine mandates in U.S. cities, and after new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
As more workers are returning to offices, more companies are changing Covid-19 protocols.
The company's hybrid-work policy takes full effect this week, and employees working in U.S. corporate offices will be expected to come into offices on a schedule that they have set with their teams.
Annie Dean, a vice president at the company, said requiring employees back to offices a specific number of days invites problems, particularly if some employees remain anxious about the pandemic.
At companies that mandate returns, many HR executives must ask themselves questions with each successive Covid wave, such as: ""What are we going to do about our vaccine policy?","U.S. companies are relaxing many of the vaccine and other Covid-related requirements that had become a staple of corporate life in the pandemic. As office occupancy nears pandemic-era highs in many U.S. cities, a number of employers have communicated new, looser safety protocols to workers. Some companies made masks optional in the office for all workers, while others dropped testing requirements for the unvaccinated or simplified the daily return-to-office questionnaires. The new protocols in many cases follow updated guidance from health authorities, who have moved away from blanket preventive measures in favor of a more targeted approach focused on limiting infection and severe illness in high-risk areas. Infections have edged up again in the U.S., and the Omicron BA.2 variant accounts for more new Covid-19 cases. JPMorgan Chase & Co. told U.S. employees in mid-March that masking in its corporate office buildings would be voluntary for both vaccinated and unvaccinated employees. The company also said that as of Monday April 4, it planned to discontinue other measures such as mandatory testing for the unvaccinated or asking employees to report Covid-19 infections. It added that it would discontinue its policy of hiring only vaccinated individuals. JPMorgan Chase says masking in its corporate office buildings will be voluntary for all U.S. employees. PHOTO: GABBY JONES for The Wall Street Journal In a memo from the company's return-to-office task force, executives noted that across the U.S., ""we are learning to live with COVID as part of our new normal."" JPMorgan Chase still insists that those feeling sick stay home and said free at-home tests would remain available. It also kept open the possibility that it could reintroduce protocols, if needed. ""Masking requirements may return if there is another spike in cases, or a variant begins to spread that causes severe illness in the general population,"" the company said. ""But this will only happen based on strict criteria or if mandated by state or local government authorities."" Some large U.S. companies, including Boeing Co., suspended vaccine requirements for U.S. employees late last year in response to legal rulings on vaccine mandates. Others have allowed some unvaccinated workers to return, while maintaining broader vaccine policies. United Airlines Holdings Inc. in recent weeks said it would allow back unvaccinated employees who got religious or medical exemptions from the company's Covid-19 vaccine mandate. Many human-resources executives say they updated their company's protocols in response to a loosening of mask and vaccine mandates in U.S. cities, and after new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC in late February eased mask guidelines and changed the metrics it uses to assess risk. As more workers are returning to offices, more companies are changing Covid-19 protocols. PHOTO: Jose A. Alvarado Jr. for The Wall Street Journal At Verizon Communications Inc., the company loosened mask policies last month at many of its sites following the CDC's recommendations. Verizon told employees that those working in areas with a high level of community transmission, as defined by the CDC, would still be required to wear a mask regardless of vaccination status, while masks would be voluntary in medium or low areas. The company also simplified a return-to-office questionnaire: Employees must certify that they aren't sick with Covid in what is now a one-question survey. Verizon's return-to-office tool will tell workers if they are required to wear a mask in a given location. The company's hybrid-work policy takes full effect this week, and employees working in U.S. corporate offices will be expected to come into offices on a schedule that they have set with their teams. Nationally, offices are beginning to fill up once more. Offices in 10 major U.S. cities were, on average, 40% occupied in late March, near a pandemic-era peak, according to badge-swipe data from security company Kastle Systems. Some workers say they remain hyperv vigilant about the pandemic and nervous about the lifting of safeguards, particularly as cases tick up. Lance Lambert, a Los Angeles vice president of marketing for a company that makes equipment used in the cannabis industry, has been traveling internationally on business trips in recent months. During a trip to a conference in Barcelona last month, Mr. Lambert noticed that the event appeared more crowded than before the pandemic. Some people he encountered had abandoned masks and appeared ""over it,"" Mr. Lambert said, while Covid remained in the back of his mind during each interaction. ""Does he have any symptoms? Is he coughing? Does he look hot, sweaty?"" Mr. Lambert said he thought when meeting people at the conference. ""It is hard to take that away from your mind."" Many companies are also taking a wait-and-see approach, wanting to hold off on ratcheting up protocols again until more is known about any new uptick in cases. Minneapolis law firm Lockridge Grindal Nauen last year mandated that its 100-person staff get vaccinated, barring an exemption for medical or religious reasons, and nearly all employees also got booster shots. The firm reinstituted a mask mandate in its office in December as cases surged but would likely wait for Minneapolis to restore an indoor mask mandate or for cases to dramatically increase before doing so again, said Susan E. Ellingstad, a partner at the firm. ""It would be different if we didn't have everyone vaccinated,"" Ms. Ellingstad said, adding she also plans to keep watching the city's positivity rate to adjust any policies, if needed. Some employers say flexibility is key if executives hope to avoid the challenges of shifting policies during each stage of the pandemic. Software developer Atlassian Corp. is embracing a model it calls ""team anywhere,"" allowing all staffers to do their jobs remotely. Annie Dean, a vice president at the company, said requiring employees back to offices a specific number of days invites problems, particularly if some employees remain anxious about the pandemic. Ms. Dean previously worked as the first-ever head of remote work at Facebook. At companies that mandate returns, many HR executives must ask themselves questions with each successive Covid wave, such as: ""What are we going to do about our vaccine policy? What are we going to do about our three-day in-office policy? How are we going to ask people to get back in the officeâ€”should we extend that another three months?"" Ms. Dean said.

Read it below. One of the most popular Pride festivals in the country has a message for JPMorgan Chase: We don't want your money. Pride Northwest, the nonprofit group that organizes the annual Pride parade in Portland, Oregon, has asked JPMorgan Chase to refrain from sponsoring its event next month, pointing to concerns about past campaign contributions by the firm, Insider has learned. Debra Porta, executive director of Pride Northwest, told Insider in an interview that Chase had approached her organization about sponsoring the 2022 Pride Parade in March. But Porta and her team decided to reject their offer after coming across a 2021 investigation by Popular Information regarding the bank's PAC spending. The story said America's largest bank by assets was one of 25 corporations that collectively spent more than $10 million since 2019 to back members of Congress who are in support of anti-LGBTQ legislation. It found that Chase's PAC contributed $275,000 to federal lawmakers who had earned a ""0"" rating from the Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBTQ advocacy organization. Popular Information also found that Chase donated $2,500 to sponsors of anti-trans legislation in five US states, including Texas and Florida. It did not name the sponsors. ""At some point, there has to be a bit of a line drawn,"" Porta told Insider. ""How do employees know that they actually work in a safe company if the company that they're working for is also funding legislators who are damaging their people?"" ""How is a queer mother, for example, down in Texas, who might work for Chase, who may not be out â€?how are they supposed to interact with Pride when Chase, or anyone else for that matter, is also funding the legislator that is putting policy in place that could literally put them in jail?,"" she added. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase declined to comment. Insider learned of the bank's rejection from sponsoring the parade via an internal email sent last week, which suggested that JPMorgan was just one of several companies that Pride Northwest had asked to refrain from sponsoring this year's festivities, based on recent political contributions. (See the full contents of the email below.) Porta declined to name the other companies. She said Pride Northwest made its decision to exclude Chase and the other companies independently, and has not been in touch with other Pride groups nationwide about the decision. Collectively, she said, the banned companies would have donated ""at least 15,000 in sponsorship dollars,"" about 8-10% of the parade's projected sponsorship revenue. Future support is still on the table The Portland Pride Parade and Festival, which will take place on June 18 and 19, has several other sponsors from the financial-services sector, Porta said, including United Community Credit Union, OnPoint Community Credit Union, and KeyBank. Sponsors of the Pride Northwest Parade and Festival pay between $3,500 to $15,000 depending on the tier they choose.

""We are having a dialogue with them,"" she added. ""It's not a dialogue about reevaluating for this year. It's a dialogue about finding a path moving forward in the future."" ""What we would like to see and would need to see is some sort of concerted internal effort to be much more intentional about PAC contributions, and acknowledging the disconnect and the harm done in advertising through Pride â€?which is what sponsorship is â€?while also directly contributing to people who are attempting to harm our community,"" Porta said. ""We would need corporate-level addressing of how decisions are made about PAC contributions."" JPMorgan Chase says on its website that it has ""long been a supporter of equality in all forms,"" including for members of LGBTQ communities. It also notes that it has been a ""strong supporter"" of other Pride initiatives, including the Pride march in New York City, where it is headquartered, for more than 15 years.

We are sad to announce Pride Northwest (the Portland Pride Parade organizers) has asked that we not sponsor the Portland Pride Parade and Festival this year. Pride Northwest's leadership pulled a list of past political contributions made by firms and their PACs in the Portland area and, based on that list, has asked several companies to not participate in the parade. We, of course, disagree and are very disappointed with this decision. We will be meeting with the Pride Northwest leadership team to discuss their decision and we're hopeful that we will be able to return again in the future. While we will not be participating under the banner of Chase, our members are of course still more than welcome to attend and participate in the festivities.

That's a 10 percent loss. By contrast, $1,000 invested in ""real world"" equities â€?oil and gas, minerals and agricultural products â€?would have turned into $1,700, a 70 percent gain. Your digital-world equities would have thrilled you by more than doubling during the second half of 2020, as stock markets feasted on cheap money supplied by the Federal Reserve Board, remained at that level through 2021, and then plunged over the past six months as stimulus subsided. Meanwhile, the ""real world"" assets marched steadily upward, beating the broader market's performance by a significant margin. Advantage, stuff. Financial markets have ""re-priced"" assets to reflect both the insubstantiality of the many highflying business plans they were previously willing to fund and the indispensability of basic supplies, such as food and energy. The lesson here is that stuff matters because stuff happens. Human beings have a hierarchy of needs, at the top of which are eating and staying warm, with internet gambling and video streaming a lot lower on the list. In a world of supply chains disrupted by unexpected events â€?the pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine â€?making stuff people can't do without is good business. There's a corollary for countries and governments: It is wise policy to maintain a healthy margin of self-sufficiency in food and energy. Reliance on imports creates, as the author of the JPMorgan Asset Management report, Michael Cembalest, notes, ""supply, price, currency stability and national security risk."" Certainly, Vladimir Putin is banking on stuff â€?specifically, continued exports of oil, gas, grain and fertilizer â€?to sustain Russia despite efforts by the United States and Europe to cripple the Russian economy through sweeping trade and financial sanctions. The jury is still out on Putin's strategy; for him, though, the inconclusive situation is already a victory of sorts, given the initial Western confidence that his regime would not be able to cope. In fact, though Europe is trying to limit Russian oil and gas imports, its inability to do without them in the short run has turned into a significant weakness for countries such as Germany and Italy, and a source of leverage for Moscow. So has the dependence on Russian goods of Brazil (fertilizer) and South Africa (wheat) in the global south. India imports all of the above from Russia, as well as the ultimate tangible product: military weapons. President Biden's trip to Saudi Arabia, including his cringeworthy fist bump with that country's dictator, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also exemplifies the power of stuff, in this case crude oil, of which the Saudis have the second-largest proven reserves in the world. Biden's attempt to curry favor with a regime he once pledged to isolate shows what can happen, geopolitically, when a democratic country's voters are unable to get their hands on a basic necessity â€?gasoline â€?at a price they can afford. Nevertheless, the United States, for all its economic woes, is relatively well-positioned to weather the current crisis because it is generally more self-sufficient in food and energy than its peer nations. This country remains the world's tech, entertainment and finance leader. The collapse of ""unicorns"" and other speculative investment vehicles, while indicative of market froth, doesn't negate all the goods and services of real value that Silicon Valley, Hollywood and Wall Street do create. The U.S. government provides one intangible â€?the world's reserve currency â€?without which other countries find it hard to get along, as the dollar's growing strength on foreign exchange markets suggests. Speaking of control over stuff, and the political power it can confer: In the United States, food, energy and minerals originate disproportionately from red America, as the JPMorgan team illustrated with a map depicting all 50 states resized according to their respective 2021 production of these goods, upon which blue American cities depend. Coal- and gas-rich West Virginia, home to Sen. Joe Manchin III (D), looks twice as big as New York; Texas swells to about triple California. Accelerating the transition to greener energy remains crucial. Even so, the importance of stuff will not soon diminish. Indeed, green technology requires mineral inputs â€?such as lithium and cobalt for electric vehicle batteries. Much of that must be imported. Lithium is available from South America and Australia. Most of the world's cobalt comes from the conflict-plagued Democratic Republic of Congo, often mined using child labor. Russia is the second-largest producer. This country needs a strategy for a world in which geopolitics, as opposed to the free market, might increasingly determine how, and where, we and our democratic allies gain access to strategic materials. It's time to get our stuff together.","<Incident Category>: human rights abuses and corporate complicity

JPMorgan Chase,JPM,2022/8/10,"tax evasion, violation of national legislation","Loan Growth Rising, Bank Winnerâ€”and Yields 3.4%
PNC Financial Services Group is one of the best-positioned regional banks in the U.S. It has the scale to compete with industry leaders like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase but isn't burdened with the stiff capital requirements of the banking giants.
With its acquisition in 2021 of the U.S. banking operations of the Spanish bank BBVA, PNC now has a presence in all of the top 30 markets in the U.S. It calls itself a national Main Street bank.
PNC's second-quarter earnings rose 30% from a year ago, to $3.42 a share.
""PNC has the scale to compete with the biggest banks, but has developed a strong lending niche with middle-market companies across the country and a strong retail banking offering,"" says Jason Goldberg, a banking analyst at Barclays.
""PNC is over-indexed to Main St. banking and commercial-lending tailwinds, under-indexed to weaker Wall St. banking headwinds, and likely a leader among banks,"" wrote Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo, after the bank reported second-quarter results in mid July.
The bank is on pace to buy back more than $3 billion of stock this year, about 4% of its market value, and return nearly all its earnings to holders in dividends and share repurchases.
PNC would beef up its consumer and corporate banking businesses.
A well-managed bank, PNC offers a nice dividend yield and a healthy outlook.","PNC Financial Services Group is one of the best-positioned regional banks in the U.S. It has the scale to compete with industry leaders like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase but isn't burdened with the stiff capital requirements of the banking giants. At a recent $173, PNC shares (ticker: PNC) also look appealing, having fallen more than 20% from a record $228 earlier this year. The stock trades for 12 times projected 2022 earnings and yields 3.5%. The bank lifted its quarterly dividend by 20%, to $1.50 a share, in April, and another increase is expected next year. With its acquisition in 2021 of the U.S. banking operations of the Spanish bank BBVA, PNC now has a presence in all of the top 30 markets in the U.S. It calls itself a national Main Street bank. CEO Bill Demchak, 59, who has run the bank for nine years, is considered one of the country's better banking executives. PNC's second-quarter earnings rose 30% from a year ago, to $3.42 a share. Revenue was up 10% while noninterest costs increased 6%, resulting in favorable operating leverage. Like its peers, PNC is seeing an expansion in net interest margins as the Federal Reserve lifts short rates and credit costs remain historically low. Loan growth was healthy at 5% in the second quarter, and the bank sees 8% growth for the year. Next year's earnings are expected to rise 14%, to about $16.50 a share, as margins widen further, even as PNC potentially absorbs higher credit costs. ""PNC has the scale to compete with the biggest banks, but has developed a strong lending niche with middle-market companies across the country and a strong retail banking offering,"" says Jason Goldberg, a banking analyst at Barclays. Goldberg rates the stock Overweight, with a $222 price target. ""PNC is over-indexed to Main St. banking and commercial-lending tailwinds, under-indexed to weaker Wall St. banking headwinds, and likely a leader among banks,"" wrote Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at Wells Fargo, after the bank reported second-quarter results in mid July. Mayo told Barron's that the banking industry is seeing ""the best commercial loan growth in 15 years. That's PNC's bread and butter. PNC is showing expense control and still-strong credit quality."" He has an Overweight rating and price target of $202. With $541 billion in assets, PNC is in the same league as rivals U.S. Bancorp (USB) and Truist Financial (TFC), but well below the big four banksâ€”JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC)â€”each in the range of $2 to $4 trillion in assets. Regulators have imposed higher capital burdens on the biggest banks, deeming them global systemically important banks, or G-SIBs. That limits their ability to repurchase stock. JPMorgan is now subject to a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 11.2%. PNC faces a 7.4% minimum capital ratio and its 9.6% second-quarter ratio comfortably exceeds that. That gives PNC the ability to pay an ample dividend and repurchase a sizable amount of stock. The bank is on pace to buy back more than $3 billion of stock this year, about 4% of its market value, and return nearly all its earnings to holders in dividends and share repurchases. The big risk for banks is a recession, and fears of one have depressed the stocks this year. PNC is prepared to deal with a downturn, having comfortably passed the Fed's stress test that simulates a severe economic recession. Demchak wasn't available for comment. On the bank's conference call last month, he said the Fed's moves to control inflation would be harder to achieve and take longer than many in the markets were assuming. ""But regardless of the path ahead macroeconomically, we believe having a strong balance sheet, a solid mix of fee-based businesses, continued focus on expense management, and differentiated strategies for organic growth will continue to provide the foundation for our success,"" the CEO said. Given its large asset base and market value of $71 billion, PNC is unlikely to become a takeover candidate, especially in view of the tough antitrust approach taken by the Biden administration. If a deal were possible, Goldman Sachs Group (GS) might be interested. PNC would beef up its consumer and corporate banking businesses. Pittsburgh-based PNC has grown in the past 15 years through acquisitions and organically. The company purchased BBVA with the proceeds of the sale of a longstanding 22% holding in BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager, in May 2020. PNC paid about 1.3 times tangible book for BBVA, a relatively low price. The strength of PNC's systems and back office was evident in the quick integration of the BBVA deal. PNC has ample capacity to make new loans, given that its ratio of loans to deposits is just 68%. It has ""a lot of dry powder,"" Mayo says. The bank gets about 60% of its revenue from net interest income and the rest from a mix of fee-oriented businesses, including asset management, capital markets, and corporate cash management. Like other banks, PNC is getting rid of consumer charges, and it eliminated overdraft fees on consumer accounts earlier this month. A well-managed bank, PNC offers a nice dividend yield and a healthy outlook.

Kraft Heinz,KHC,2019/5/6,"fraud, violation of national legislation","Kraft Heinz Restate Financial Investigation; Restatements 2016; probe revealed misconduct procurement division
Kraft Heinz Co. said errors in its accounting go back several more years than previously known, widening the scope of the internal problems the beleaguered food company has to resolve while facing a federal securities probe and shareholder lawsuits.
Kraft Heinz, which is facing an investigation into its procurement practices by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it had received an additional subpoena on March 1 pertaining to the write-down of some of its brands.
Investors have been seeking updates from Kraft Heinz in the three months since it disclosed the regulatory investigation and said it was writing down the value of some of its brands by $15 billion.
Kraft Heinz's private-equity backers, 3G Capital, have also faced new questions over the cost-cutting approach that they wielded at Kraft Heinz and other companies to increase profits.
Kraft Heinz said Monday that its internal investigation was nearly complete, and it revealed misconduct by several staff members in its procurement division.
Eduardo Luz, Kraft Heinz's global brand officer and chief marketing officer in the U.S., is leaving at the end of May, the spokesman said.
""The company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits,"" Kraft Heinz said in an SEC filing on Monday.
(April 23) * Kraft Heinz's New CEO Faces Tough Task: Revive 'Dusty' Brands (April 22) * Analysis: Food Companies Take a Break From the Deal Table(April 8) * Has Kraft Heinz Made $24 Billion Since Merger or $6 Billion?","Kraft Heinz Co. said errors in its accounting go back several more years than previously known, widening the scope of the internal problems the beleaguered food company has to resolve while facing a federal securities probe and shareholder lawsuits. The company said Monday it is restating a host of its financial results dating as far back as 2016, after it determined they included certain misstatements. The adjustments now total $208 million. Kraft Heinz, which is facing an investigation into its procurement practices by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said it had received an additional subpoena on March 1 pertaining to the write-down of some of its brands. The company said it is cooperating with regulators. It has missed a handful of financial reporting deadlines, and Kraft Heinz couldn't say Monday when the reports, including the full-year financial report for 2018, would be filed. On Monday, shares in Kraft Heinz shares rose 1%, but were down 24% this year. Investors have been seeking updates from Kraft Heinz in the three months since it disclosed the regulatory investigation and said it was writing down the value of some of its brands by $15 billion. Lead investor Warren Buffett has since said that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and 3G Capital overpaid when they helped form Kraft Heinz through a merger in 2015. Mr. Buffett defended the company during his annual meeting over the weekend, but reiterated that deals can sour by paying too much. Kraft Heinz is seeking to move beyond the wave of challenging developments and reassure investors about the company's management and growth potential. It said it didn't find that the financial misstatements were material, but involved the incorrect timing of reporting costs and rebates in contracts. Its latest disclosure, however, shows the extent of the accounting problems that have contributed to the big food company losing nearly $20 billion in value. Kraft Heinz's private-equity backers, 3G Capital, have also faced new questions over the cost-cutting approach that they wielded at Kraft Heinz and other companies to increase profits. 3G helped broker the merger of Kraft and Heinz, and worked to deliver profit by slashing the combined company's workforce, curbing expenses and pushing suppliers to give more favorable terms. It also cut research and marketing spending at a time when many of Kraft Heinz's signature packaged-food brands were losing favor with customers. Sales dropped as a result. Kraft Heinz has since beefed up its sales force and marketing efforts with retailers. It is also looking to sell underperforming brands such as its Ore-Ida french fries and Maxwell House coffee divisions, according to people familiar with the matter. Other 3G-backed consumer companies are also struggling with sales as they try to compete on staple brands while still keeping costs down. Anheuser-Busch InBev SA has faced stagnating sales in the U.S., while the holding company behind Burger King and Tim Horton's, Restaurant Brands International Inc., recently reported a decline in same-store salesgrowth. Kraft Heinz said Monday that its internal investigation was nearly complete, and it revealed misconduct by several staff members in its procurement division. ""The findings from the investigation did not identify any misconduct by any member of the senior management team,"" a Kraft Heinz spokesman said. A number of staff in the procurement division were let go. The company also telegraphed more change in its senior ranks. Eduardo Luz, Kraft Heinz's global brand officer and chief marketing officer in the U.S., is leaving at the end of May, the spokesman said. Last month, Kraft Heinz named a new chief executive, Miguel Patricio, to succeed current head Bernardo Hees as of July 1. Meanwhile, several pension funds are suing Kraft Heinz in regards to the company's falling stock. Trading firm Timber Hill has filed a case detailing allegations of insider trading. ""The company intends to vigorously defend against these lawsuits,"" Kraft Heinz said in an SEC filing on Monday. Attorneys for Kraft Heinz have agreed to have the two cases consolidated under a U.S. District Judge in Chicago. A first appearance is scheduled for May 16. The company is restating several financial statements beginning in 2016 and 2017. Its net income for 2016, 2017 and 2018 will change by less than a percentage point, the company has found so far. ""The company is taking action to improve our policies and procedures and will continue to strengthen our internal financial controls,"" the company spokesman said.

Kraft Heinz,KHC,2019/8/8,"fraud, violation of national legislation","Stock Price-Related Impairment Charges Expected Rise Markets Fluctuate; Kraft Heinz booked $474 charge relation decline stock price. companies follow, impairment analysts
Stock price-related impairment charges such as the one booked Thursday by Kraft Heinz Co. are expected to increase amid ongoing market turbulence and an uncertain economic outlook.
U.S. stock prices have been high for years, and market turbulenceâ€”as seen on Monday, when indexes suffered their worst day of the year, or a sustained correction because of weakening economic sentimentâ€”could force more companies to book charges in response to a decline in their share prices, impairment analysts said.
""The expectation is that if the general economic trend continues and market valuations decline, impairment charges connected to stock price falls increase,"" said Greg Franceschi, a managing director at advisory firm Duff & Phelps LLC and global leader of its financial reporting valuation advisory practice.
Companies have to book an impairment when their stock price falls and remains low after a transaction, even if management believes the decline is just temporary, Ms. Newell of BDO said.
""If the market does not share the company's view,"" she said, ""the company has to take a charge."" There are no clear-cut rules on how long a stock price has to be down or by how much it has to fall to trigger such an impairment, Mr. Franceschi said.","Stock price-related impairment charges such as the one booked Thursday by Kraft Heinz Co. are expected to increase amid ongoing market turbulence and an uncertain economic outlook. Kraft Heinz said it booked a charge of $1.22 billion for the first six months of its fiscal year. The bulk of the charge was related to the declining values of brands and businesses, but $474 million of it reflected the company's lower stock price. Kraft Heinz's stock has fallen 38% since the beginning of the year. It was down 8.6% at market close Thursday. Companies record goodwill impairments when they acquire a business for more than the value of its identifiable assets, such as factories, cash and patents. The buyer has to measure the fair value of its reporting entities. If that figure is found to be lower than the amount recorded on the books, the buyer writes down the value of the goodwill. Mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. targets have risen to $1.06 trillion since the beginning of the year, up from $889.2 billion during the same period last year, according to data provider Dealogic Ltd. A high volume of dealsâ€”and juiced-up valuesâ€”in recent years could mean more stock price-related impairments are waiting in the wings, particularly if the markets decline for a sustained period. H.J. Heinz Co. merged with Kraft Foods Group Inc. in 2015 in a deal worth about $49 billion. The combined company in February wrote down more than $15 billion for some of its key Kraft and Oscar Mayer brands amid waning consumer demand. Kraft Heinz's share price fell from a high of $48.26 in February and has been trading between $27 and $33 since then. A sustained decrease in a company's stock price both in absolute terms and relative to its peers also qualifies for impairment charges. U.S. stock prices have been high for years, and market turbulenceâ€”as seen on Monday, when indexes suffered their worst day of the year, or a sustained correction because of weakening economic sentimentâ€”could force more companies to book charges in response to a decline in their share prices, impairment analysts said. ""The expectation is that if the general economic trend continues and market valuations decline, impairment charges connected to stock price falls increase,"" said Greg Franceschi, a managing director at advisory firm Duff & Phelps LLC and global leader of its financial reporting valuation advisory practice. The trend is even more profound during economic recessions, said Angela Newell, an assurance partner at BDO USA LLP. U.S. companies booked $35.1 billion in goodwill impairments in 2017, according to data from Duff & Phelps. That is up 23% from 2016, when goodwill charges amounted to $28.5 billion. Tests for impairments must conducted annually. In the interim, certain eventsâ€”such as the discovery of new value-depreciating issues with acquired assetsâ€”can trigger additional write-downs. Kraft Heinz usually tests for impairments in the second quarter, Chief Financial Officer David Knopf said during an earnings call on Thursday. There is a continued risk of future impairments at the company, he added. U.S. gross domestic product rose at a 2.1% annual rate in the second quarter, down from 3.1% in the first quarter, according to the Commerce Department. Regulators and auditors are expected to pay more attention to write-downs related to stock price declines should the U.S. economy continue to slow, Mr. Franceschi said. Companies have to book an impairment when their stock price falls and remains low after a transaction, even if management believes the decline is just temporary, Ms. Newell of BDO said. ""If the market does not share the company's view,"" she said, ""the company has to take a charge."" There are no clear-cut rules on how long a stock price has to be down or by how much it has to fall to trigger such an impairment, Mr. Franceschi said.

Both 3G and Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which orchestrated the merger, remain top shareholders in the company. Mr. Knopf, 31, plans to return to 3G, where he has been a partner since 2015. Mr. Basilio has been a 3G partner since 2012. The decision by Kraft Heinz Co. to replace its finance chief underscores the high-stakes balancing act performed by CFOs at companies with substantial private-equity backing. CFOs must maintain open lines of communication with private-equity investors, who often demand constant, detailed updates on performance, while also managing day-to-day financial operations at companies that typically carry high levels of debt, recruiters said. Private-equity firms often replace CFOs and other senior-level executives soon after they acquire a company. ""There's actually a lot of connectivity between the CFO and the sponsors,"" said Jenna Fisher, global head of the CFO practice at leadership advisory and executive search firm Russell Reynolds Associates. ""Probably more than with the CEO at times.""

""What  investors are looking for is insights into the operational metrics and guidance on the performance of the business,"" Ms. Stewart said. Mr. Basilio returns to his old role at a critical time for Kraft Heinz, which has struggled in recent months to generate sales growth.

PHOTO: Barrett Emke for the Wall Street Journal The coronavirus hit a Kraft Heinz Co. macaroni-and-cheese factory last month, forcing Brooke Burk to make a change that is a bit out of character for someone who deals with people all day. Ms. Burk, a human-resources staffer, asked to have a plexiglass shield installed around her desk to separate her from other employees while she meets with them. ""It kind of looks like a fish tank in here,"" she said during a recent interview from her office at the Springfield, Mo., factory. As the new coronavirus forces big changes in how we work, The Wall Street Journal is looking at how different people are coping with the stresses and risks.

She could be working from home, but has decided she needs to be there in person to support line and warehouse workers. She implements and enforces social distancing at the factoryâ€”from production lines to the breakroom to the human-resources office where she sits. That job got tougher when two people in the warehouse were diagnosed with Covid-19 last month. ""I was just inundated with people coming in, you know, nervous and scared,"" Ms. Burk said. Kraft Heinz alerted workers using an emergency response system set up mostly for severe weather. The factory was closed for a couple of days in late March for deep cleaning, and management ramped up preventive measures when it reopened. After the reopening, a few more people who had gone out sick were tested for Covid-19. ""Those were people that I had interacted with,"" she said. ""That was kind of like a defining moment."" They ended up testing negative. There has been little time to slow down and catch a breath. Food companies are racing to meet unprecedented demand for items like Oscar Mayer deli meat or Velveeta cheese. While a small number of the nearly 1,000 employees at the plant are able to work from home, most need to be present. ""We do need them here. We do need them to feel safe while we're here. Because we need to keep getting that food out the door,"" Ms. Burk said. Ms. Burk, 46, has printed out signs about hand-washing, and put markings on the floors of the cafeteria and the factory to keep people at a distance from each other. She put signs on the tables in the break room that said, ""Don't sit here, sit here,"" to keep people 6 feet apart. One department slowed a production line to allow 6 feet of space between workers that pass items back and forth by hand. It takes them longer to walk back and forth now. Packages of Kraft Singles move through conveyor belts at a production plant in Springfield, Mo. PHOTO: Barrett Emke for the Wall Street Journal Ms. Burk made sure every table in the cafeteria had hand sanitizer. She helped hire three temporary workers to clean doorknobs, table tops and other surfaces. Management spread out time clocks to keep employees from congregating while clocking in and out. ""It honestly was a really, really crazy time for that first couple weeks,"" she said. ""Since then, I can't say that it's gotten any less crazy."" SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How is your work changing because of the coronavirus crisis? Join the conversation below. The health risk and long hours have been a strain on her family. Ms. Burk's wife, Amanda, who she has been with for almost 24 years, is at home with their four children, who range in age from 6 to 17. ""I have the easier job. But it's a little stressful,"" Ms. Burk said. The factory has implemented a health screening, asking workers a few questions before they enter, and this week started taking their temperatures. Ms. Burk also had nearly all the chairs removed from the cafeteria so that people sit farther apart during their lunch break. ""People were just moving chairs. So we were like, 'Nope, we've got to take this a step further,'"" she said. Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the U.S., Kraft Heinz Co. has implemented new safety measures at its Springfield, Mo., plant.

OTTAWA â€?The Canadian government on Tuesday said it would buy an oil pipeline to the countryâ€™s west coast, ensuring that its widely protested expansion will go forward.
The Trans Mountain pipeline, which carries oil from Alberta to a port in a suburb of Vancouver, British Columbia, has become a flashpoint in a wider debate in Canada over the environmental impact of tapping Albertaâ€™s oil sands.
The purchase of the pipeline, for 4.5 billion Canadian dollars, puts the government squarely on the side of the oil industry.
The decision to buy the pipeline from its American owner, Kinder Morgan, may become the biggest test of Mr. Trudeauâ€™s assertion that his government is balancing the needs of the energy industry with environmental concerns like climate change.
Aurore Fauret, a campaign coordinator for the environmental group 350.org, said Mr. Trudeau â€œhas moved from being a climate leader to a pipeline cheerleader.â€?She vowed that protests would continue.
A previous plan to link the oil sands with the coast of British Columbia was abandoned, as was a proposed pipeline to eastern Canada.
The pipeline plan has also started an unusually acrimonious war of words, litigation and legislation between British Columbia and Alberta, which relies on the energy industry for high-paying jobs and billions of dollars in resource royalty payments.
Mr. Horganâ€™s opposition to the pipeline appears rooted, at least partly, in political calculations in British Columbia.

HOUSTON, June 19 (Reuters) - Major U.S. energy companies including Plains All American Pipeline, Hess Corp and Kinder Morgan Inc are among many seeking exemptions from steel-import tariffs as the United States ratchets up trade tensions with exporters including China, Canada and Mexico.

There have been nearly 21,000 requests overall for exclusions submitted to the U.S. Commerce Department since the Trump administration imposed levies this year. Of those, more than 500 petitions involve pipes and related materials. Initial decisions are expected this month, offering the first clues as to how the administration will balance an agenda favoring oil and gas exports while also supporting the U.S. steel and aluminum industries. For the energy industry, the potential for relief has taken on added importance after China surprised markets last week by proposing 25 percent levies on about $1 billion a month in U.S. oil imports in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. The pipeline industry could face higher costs from tariffs as about 77 percent of the steel used in U.S. pipelines is imported, according to a 2017 study for the pipeline industry. Benchmark hot-rolled U.S. steel coil prices are up more than 50 percent from a year ago, according to S&P Global Platts. Pipelines from the nation's largest oilfield in west Texas to the Gulf Coast are nearly full, depressing crude prices as output is projected to rise by about 850,000 barrels per day this year, and significant projects are not expected to be completed until at least next year. Plains sought a tariff exclusion for its 500-mile Cactus II oil pipeline, which will connect West Texas oil fields to export docks near Corpus Christi, Texas. This month, it expects to receive its first material from Corinth Pipeworks SA, a Greek manufacturer, according to a Commerce Department filing. ""We think tariffs would be unjust, but we can tolerate"" them, Greg Armstrong, chief executive of Plains All American Pipeline, told investors this month, adding that tariffs and import quotas could hurt U.S. production growth. No U.S. mills can produce pipe with the specifications needed for Plains' line. Only three mills in the world make such pipe, and delivery delays could exacerbate constraints, the company wrote in its petition, affecting the price of oil from the largest U.S. oilfield. The 585,000-barrel per day line is due to start flowing next year, just as analysts warn a bottleneck of crude could force some producers to shut in production. Total pipeline, rail and local refining capacity from the Permian Basin oilfield in March was 3.175 million barrels per day (bpd), according to energy intelligence service Genscape, just shy of the oilfield's roughly 3.3 million bpd output in June. Rival pipeline operator Kinder Morgan also wants an exclusion for its $1.75 billion Gulf Coast Express natural gas pipeline from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast. It ordered 47 percent of specialized pipe needed for the project from Turkish steel maker Borusan Mannesmann. Only one U.S. producer could meet Kinder Morgan's needs, but it could not meet the volume required within the necessary timeline, Kinder said in a filing. The United States is committed to acting on exclusion requests within 90 days of a petition being posted for comments, a Commerce Department spokesman said. The United States could offer refunds on tariffs paid since a petition became active. For companies unwilling to take the risk of having a request denied, ""it may mean cutting back or pushing the timeline out farther"" for some projects, said Brigham McCown, former head of regulator U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. Oil and gas producer Hess cited safety concerns in a request to use Japanese pipe for its Stampede offshore project in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. ""Without the ability to use this product, we will not be able to guarantee corrosion resistance in deepwater operations using other currently available steel products - potentially compromising both safety and environmental protection,"" the company wrote in its filing. Between 2015 and 2016, the U.S. imported between about $5 billion and $8 billion in steel line pipe, valves and fittings for the pipeline industry, according to a study by consultancy ICF for the American Petroleum Institute. ""There's lots of concern that the increased cost in pipe will increase the costs for our oil,"" said North Dakota Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who wants Congress to vote on tariffs imposed under national security grounds. ""You pull on one string in international trade and it unravels in ways you could not have predicted.""

The efforts could help big greenhouse gas emitters reduce their carbon emissions intensity and move closer to Paris Agreement climate change targets. Energy giants view these efforts as balancing customer demands for more oil and gas while fitting in a lower-carbon energy world. Carbon removal technologies will be necessary to limit the increase in planetary warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, the United Nations has said. KINDER MORGAN INC Pipeline operator Kinder Morgan has formed a business unit to acquire assets and build new services around carbon storage, renewable gas and diesel, hydrogen and power generation and transmission. Its Energy Transition Ventures unit aims to broaden low-carbon projects already in development, the company said. The operation will have its own financial, commercial and engineering staff to develop and commercialize new projects. BAKER HUGHES CO The oilfield equipment and services firm acquired Norwegian technology firm Compact Carbon Capture (3C) and plans to commercialize its solvent-based products. 3C says its scalable designs can be as little as a quarter of the footprint of other carbon-capturing systems. Baker Hughes will market the rotating 3C equipment alongside its products and services to industries including oil and gas, liquefied natural gas, shipping and pipeline operators. 3C's industrial-scale unit designs could capture up to 250,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. EXXON MOBIL CORP Exxon Mobil formed Low Carbon Solutions LLC, offering to make available its technologies and projects that Exxon deployed to sequester its planet-warming CO2 emissions. The business also aims to leverage Exxon 's experience in producing hydrogen gas. The Low Carbon business will leverage Exxon 's CO2 storage caverns along the U.S. Gulf Coast and under the North Sea. It also will market emissions-reduction credits from the use of its sequestration projects. OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CORP Occidental formed Oxy Low Carbon Ventures to marshal its carbon capture, utilization and emissions reduction operations. It and private equity investor Rusheen Capital Management formed 1PointFive, a Texas business that aims to capture CO2 directly from the air and bury it underground. United Airlines pledged a multimillion dollar investment in 1PointFive and will become a customer of the business, aiming to absorb the equivalent annual carbon emissions of 10% of its aircraft. TOTAL SE Total has pledged to put 10% of its research and development budget to advance carbon capture, utilization and storage technology.

Kinder Morgan said on Tuesday that El Paso will be reducing the operating pressure on the entire Line 2000 system.","Aug 25 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Kinder Morgan Inc's El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline LLC unit said it will reduce operating pressure on its Line 2000 natural gas pipeline system, which suffered a deadly explosion in Arizona last week. That reduction will likely cut supplies of natural gas from the Permian basin in Texas and New Mexico to California and other parts of the U.S. Desert Southwest just as another heatwave starts to settle across the region later this week. Energy traders said the combination of hot weather, which will boost the amount of gas power generators burn to keep air conditioners humming, and lower gas supplies should boost gas prices in California later this week as temperatures rise. After a week of cooler than normal weather, high temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to soar from the 70s Fahrenheit (24 Celsius) from Aug. 18-24 to the low 90s on Aug. 26-27, according to AccuWeather. The city's normal high at this time of year is 85 degrees. Gas prices at the Southern California Citygate <NG-SCL-CGT-SNL> fell to a near one-month low of $4.15 per million British thermal units on Friday before rising to a one-week high of $5.07 on Tuesday. The 30-inch El Paso pipe exploded on Aug. 15 near Coolidge, Arizona, killing two people. Coolidge is located about 55 miles southeast of Phoenix. Kinder Morgan said on Tuesday that El Paso will be reducing the operating pressure on the entire Line 2000 system. Gas flows at the El Paso Cimarron compressor in southeast Arizona dropped from over 0.5 billion cubic feet per day earlier in August to around zero since the Aug. 15 explosion.

Coca-Cola Company (The),KO,2018/8/23,"discrimination in employment, violation of national legislation","Clear Beer? Judge Drink Color; future beer, soda coffee colorlessâ€”at Japan
TOKYOâ€”The drink in the bottle might look clear, but one tastes like coffee, another is flavored like Coca-Cola and a third lays claim to ""beer taste."" Japanese beverage makers are increasingly producing products that look like water but taste like other drinks, betting that consumers want the taste of Coke or beer in a healthier-looking clear liquid.
""The need for drinks that people can enjoy without any hesitation is one of the reasons behind growing demand for clear-color beverages in Japan,"" said Ryo Otsu, a creator of a clear nonalcoholic beer that Suntory Holdings Ltd. began selling in June.
Akari Utsunomiya, an analyst for the market-research firm, said these products are perceived as ""modern, healthy, cool sort of beverages."" Convenience stores in Japan are stocking more drinks like ""All-Free All-Time"" from Suntory's beer-making unit.
The label of its stubby clear-plastic bottle is decorated with a sheaf of barley and the slogan ""beer taste."" Suntory hoped the amber-colored nonalcoholic beer it introduced in 2010 would catch on with office workers, who could drink it at their desks and in meetings.
""It feels healthier to drink clear-color drinks,"" she said.
Their success has caught the attention of competitors like Asahi Group Holdings Ltd.'s soft-drinks unit, which in May started selling a 60-calorie latte espresso-water called Clear Latte.
It took 170 prototypes of the zero-caffeine, zero-fat coffee to get the taste right, said Yuichi Abiru, assistant manager of the water division at Asahi Soft Drinks.
In the U.S., clear drinks became a fad in the early 1990s with brands such as Clearly Canadian soft drinks; Miller Clear, a transparent beer; and Crystal Pepsi, the colorless cola that was launched with fanfare before sales fizzled.","TOKYOâ€”The drink in the bottle might look clear, but one tastes like coffee, another is flavored like Coca-Cola and a third lays claim to ""beer taste."" Japanese beverage makers are increasingly producing products that look like water but taste like other drinks, betting that consumers want the taste of Coke or beer in a healthier-looking clear liquid. The latest wave of water-like drinks hints at the contortions companies must go through to satisfy consumer demands for flavorful drinks that are also good for you and inoffensive-looking. ""The need for drinks that people can enjoy without any hesitation is one of the reasons behind growing demand for clear-color beverages in Japan,"" said Ryo Otsu, a creator of a clear nonalcoholic beer that Suntory Holdings Ltd. began selling in June. Flavored, bottled water sales have more than doubled in both the U.S. and Japan in the past five years. Americans now drink some 2.4 billion liters of flavored water annually, according to Euromonitor. Akari Utsunomiya, an analyst for the market-research firm, said these products are perceived as ""modern, healthy, cool sort of beverages."" Convenience stores in Japan are stocking more drinks like ""All-Free All-Time"" from Suntory's beer-making unit. To make it, Suntory drained the color from its nonalcoholic beer, added lime flavoring and increased the carbonation. The label of its stubby clear-plastic bottle is decorated with a sheaf of barley and the slogan ""beer taste."" Suntory hoped the amber-colored nonalcoholic beer it introduced in 2010 would catch on with office workers, who could drink it at their desks and in meetings. But the color and the can deterred people who said their colleagues might think they were drinking on the job. Kim Yan, 45 years old, liked the clear Suntory brew she tried at a recent sampling event at a shared office space in central Tokyo. ""It feels healthier to drink clear-color drinks,"" she said. Tsubasa Takai, 23, who works for an online-content company, wasn't enthusiastic about drinking it at his desk. ""It's beer water,"" Mr. Takai said. ""It reminds you that you're not having fun; you're at work."" Drink makers face heavy pressure in Japan to generate sales in a mature and highly segmented market. Drink makers regularly introduce nearly 100 new drinks a year here. Last year, Suntory started selling a clear beverage that is meant to taste like tea with milk. The drink, made with real tea leaves, sold well, so Suntory followed it up with a peach-tea-flavored water this year. Their success has caught the attention of competitors like Asahi Group Holdings Ltd.'s soft-drinks unit, which in May started selling a 60-calorie latte espresso-water called Clear Latte. The company also launched clear ""matcha"" green tea on Aug. 7. It took 170 prototypes of the zero-caffeine, zero-fat coffee to get the taste right, said Yuichi Abiru, assistant manager of the water division at Asahi Soft Drinks. Asahi didn't want the drink to taste too sweetâ€”people might think it wasn't healthyâ€”and it wanted to keep the calorie count down, he said. The result, he said, tastes like a cup of watered-down, cold coffee. Asahi sold 400,000 cases, with 24 bottles per case, in the three weeks after Clear Latte was introduced in May. That is already 30% of Asahi's annual 1.5 million-cases target. In the U.S., clear drinks became a fad in the early 1990s with brands such as Clearly Canadian soft drinks; Miller Clear, a transparent beer; and Crystal Pepsi, the colorless cola that was launched with fanfare before sales fizzled. ""Saturday Night Live'' poked fun at the trend with a parody commercial for fictitious Crystal Gravy. By 1994, the trend was largely over in the U.S., and many of the products disappeared from store shelves amid shrinking sales. PepsiCo Inc., though, recently reintroduced Crystal Pepsi for a limited time. Coca-Cola Co.'s Japan unit launched ""Coca-Cola Clear"" in June, a zero-calorie version flavored with lemon. Removing the signature caramel color took more than a year of tweaking, said Khalil Younes, an executive vice president at Coca-Cola Japan. ""The caramel color is part of the DNA of Coca-Cola. To remove that essential component of the formula required really a development from scratch,"" he said. In advertisements on national television, Coca-Cola portrays the clear drink as the perfect summer refresher. Mr. Younes said some five million people in this nation of 126 million join the sparkling beverage market in the summertime, when the weather in most of Japan is extremely humid. Will customers in the U.S. and other countries get to try the drink that tastes but doesn't look like Coke? ""It will have a huge trial in Japan,"" Mr. Younes said, ""and then we will have to see where it will eventually settle.

Coca-Cola (KO, US) said last month that it was eyeing the cannabis sector, specifically the market for CBD-infused drinks, or those that contain non-psychoactive ingredients found in cannabis that are widely thought to have health benefits. â€œThe space is evolving quickly. No decisions have been made at this time,â€?Coca-Cola said at the time. The comment fueled speculation that Coca-Cola would follow Constellation Brands Inc. (STZ, US), which has invested $4 billion in Canadaâ€™s Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC, US) (WEED, CA). There were reports that rival Diageo PLC (DGE, UK) was also looking at targets. The market for CBD drinks is expected to grow to more than $2 billion in sales within two years, according to Science Daily. Coca-Cola Chief Executive James Quincey was clear in his response to an analyst question on the companyâ€™s earnings call: â€œWe donâ€™t have any plans at this stage to get into the space. So thatâ€™s kind of where we are,â€?Quincey said, according to a FactSet transcript of the call. Jason Wilson, president of Budding Equity Asset Management and a partner in the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF, said itâ€™s not surprising Coca-Cola is holding back for now and shouldnâ€™t be interpreted as meaning it will not enter the sector. â€œUnlike the beer, wine and spirits sector, cannabis or CBD-infused beverages are not an imminent threat to non-alcoholic beverages sales, so it makes sense that a large, multinational, non-alcoholic beverage manufacturer like Coca-Cola would to take a wait-and-see approach,â€?he said in emailed comments. â€œIn contrast, the sales of alcoholic beverage producers and distributors are under more immediate threat of cannibalization, which is why we have seen companies like Constellation Brands and Molson Coors (TAP, US) enter the cannabis space.â€?Read now: Dubious pot stock IGC has trading suspended, shares to be delisted A guide to pot stocks:What you need to know to invest in cannabis companies The Horizons Marijuana Life Sciences ETF (HMMJ, CA) was last up 1.1%, while the ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF (MJ, US) was up 1.5%.

Coca-Cola Company (The),KO,2019/9/16,animal mistreatment,"Metals billionaire Andrew Forrest making $300 bet big commodity â€?plastic; Minderoo Foundation aims eliminate plastic waste creating closed plastic economy â€?Coca-Cola Unilever
Thatâ€™s the belief of Andrew â€œTwiggyâ€?Forrestâ€™s Minderoo Foundation in Australia, which has pledged US$300 million as incentives for a new global industry-focused initiative to end plastic waste by charging more for virgin plastic created from fossil fuels, he announced Wednesday.
The initiative, called â€œSea The Future,â€?is projected to raise in excess of US$20 billion annually for global recycling, collection and environmental remediation through a voluntary contribution payable on plastics produced from fossil fuels, in other words, â€œnewâ€?plastic, explains the founder and former chairman of Fortescue Metals.
â€œIndustry, fully supported by governments and regulators, is the only sector that can drive the urgent, global shift needed to save our oceans from plastic waste,â€?said Forrest, who with his wife Nicola Forrest, established Minderoo in 2001.
â€œWe have less than five years to make this happen.â€?Related: Slower economy undermines business efforts to go carbon free, but goal is still sustainability by 2030 Most of the 350 million-plus metric tons of plastic produced every year enter the worldâ€™s terrestrial and marine environments.
â€œAt Unilever we are committed to ending ocean plastic and we welcome cross-industry initiatives, like the Minderoo Foundationâ€™s, that is looking across the value chain to identify scalable solutions,â€?said Alan Jope, the companyâ€™s(UL, US) CEO.","Minderoo Foundation aims to eliminate plastic waste by creating a closed plastic economy â€?and Coca-Cola and Unilever like it Rethinking plastic as a commodity, keeping it in a closed economy and out of landfills for long, is the best way to unclog the worldâ€™s oceans. Thatâ€™s the belief of Andrew â€œTwiggyâ€?Forrestâ€™s Minderoo Foundation in Australia, which has pledged US$300 million as incentives for a new global industry-focused initiative to end plastic waste by charging more for virgin plastic created from fossil fuels, he announced Wednesday. With interest from giant plastic users such as Coca-Cola and Unilever, the goal now is to bring the fossil fuel industry on board. The initiative, called â€œSea The Future,â€?is projected to raise in excess of US$20 billion annually for global recycling, collection and environmental remediation through a voluntary contribution payable on plastics produced from fossil fuels, in other words, â€œnewâ€?plastic, explains the founder and former chairman of Fortescue Metals. The voluntary contribution is not payable on recycled plastics, immediately making it a cheaper alternative feedstock. Forrest notes there are â€œa manageableâ€?100 or so major plastic producers using resin from oil and gas companies. And he says heâ€™s contacted them in the early days of the rollout, although potential participants were not yet named. The funds, collected at the resin-production level, will be reinvested into projects that accelerate the industryâ€™s transition toward a circular plastics economy as well as environmental remediation efforts. The voluntary contribution for fossil fuel-based plastics would start at US$200 per metric ton, up to about $5,000 per metric ton for those plastics most difficult to recycle. As â€œbadâ€?plastic that can be recycled becomes just as desirable, demand dominoes through the value chain and turns plastic waste into a cashable commodity, driving collection efforts. â€œThe technology  already exists and itâ€™s scalable, itâ€™s just about reassigning value,â€?he said in an interview. â€œItâ€™s no different than copper.â€?And yes, consumers presumably would shoulder some of the cost, but also keep plastic in the closed system. But, added Forrest, in the interview, itâ€™s about changing consumer minds to think of plastic as a commodity as well: â€œIf you make a bag or a bottle half a cent or a cent more, itâ€™ll make you think about alternative carriers and recycle. Again, thinking commodity, not waste.â€?The initiative will also, Forrest believes, help alleviate poverty through job opportunities at landfills and recycling centers, particularly in South East Asia where the waste problem is at its worst. â€œIndustry, fully supported by governments and regulators, is the only sector that can drive the urgent, global shift needed to save our oceans from plastic waste,â€?said Forrest, who with his wife Nicola Forrest, established Minderoo in 2001. â€œWe have less than five years to make this happen.â€?Related: Slower economy undermines business efforts to go carbon free, but goal is still sustainability by 2030 Most of the 350 million-plus metric tons of plastic produced every year enter the worldâ€™s terrestrial and marine environments. And best estimates suggest that plastic costs humanity over US$2.2 trillion a year in environmental and social damage, an academic paper in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science says. Forrest, a candidate for a PhD in marine ecology, is one of the contributors. Forrestâ€™s US$300 million commitment consists of $40 million in startup capital and $1 million per week for 260 weeks for a global organization that would independently audit the initiative and funds raised from it. Forrest is worth US$7.4 billion today but he was once Australiaâ€™s richest man, with his net worth peaking at $12.7 billion in June 2008 when shares of Fortescue, now the worldâ€™s fourth-largest iron ore producer, hit an all-time high, according to Forbes. Down the supply chain, there is buy-in, if with some caution for getting industry and government to align. â€œAt Unilever we are committed to ending ocean plastic and we welcome cross-industry initiatives, like the Minderoo Foundationâ€™s, that is looking across the value chain to identify scalable solutions,â€?said Alan Jope, the companyâ€™s(UL, US) CEO. This will be achieved â€œonly by rethinking plastic â€?from design to collection â€?and recognizing it as a valuable resource which should be kept in the economy and out of the environment.â€?Brian Smith, president and COO, at the Coca-Cola Company(KO, US) noted the bottler has had its own role to play in finding a solution to plastic waste. In 2018, in an effort to develop its own circular economy for its plastic packaging, Coke launched what it called the World Without Waste initiative. â€œWe recognized that no one entity, government or stakeholder, can solve this issue alone, so we routinely work with organizations and agencies around the world to identify, develop and scale potential solutions,â€?said Smith. â€œOne such idea is the concept outlined by Minderoo Foundation which, with further development, has the potential to accelerate the realization of a circular economy and help arrest the flow of plastic into our environment. The proposal requires partnering with industry, governments, regulators and other key stakeholders to ensure that its implementation is respectful of and compliant with the various laws and regulations of each country.â€?Read:Banks worth $47 trillion adopt UN-backed climate pact â€?but only 3 of the top 10 The initiative is announced on the same day that Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison addresses this weekâ€™s United Nations summit, which has included a focus on the environment. A Morrison-led Australia has yet to lay out stepped-up targets toward net-zero emissions and Morrison has been quoted saying the debate on climate change is brining about â€œneedless anxietyâ€?for children. Read: Sixty-six UN participants pledge ambitious climate goals, as 30 vow to be carbon neutral by midcentury The Minderoo initiative is also expected to make a material contribution to reducing plastic-induced climate change by some 70% in the context of the global communityâ€™s targeted temperature increase range by 2050.","<Incident Category>: animal mistreatment

The Coca-Cola Co. announced Thursday that in March 2020 it will launch a new flavored seltzer brand it is calling ""Aha."" Taking aim at weakening brand LaCroix and Pepsi's successful Bubly line, Aha will come in eight flavors, two of which â€?Citrus Green Tea and Black Cherry + Coffee â€?will contain 30 mg of caffeine, riding another trend and aiming at contenders such as Hiball sparkling-energy drink from Anheuser-Busch.
Aha, the brand's biggest new release in a decade, will replace Coke's Dasani sparkling water, which according to Shane Grant, president of the stills business unit for Coca-Cola North America, has underperformed.
Grant said that consumers are looking to carbonated water for singular flavors but also to serve different functions, including simple refreshment, relaxation or energy enhancement.
Although Dasani sparkling waters are in cans, the iconic Dasani and Smartwater packaging is clear plastic bottles.
The preferred packaging for bubbly water, Grant said, is cans.

Aha will debut in an eight-pack of 12-ounce cans and in 16-ounce single-serve cans, with pricing in line with mainstream sparkling waters. According to marketing materials, Coca-Cola's launch taps into the ""huge consumer wellness trend,"" but some of this trend pulls against purchased beverages overall. The market researcher NPD Group estimates beverage consumption overall in the United States has fallen from an average 1,127 beverages per person in 2014 to 1,104 in 2019. This doesn't mean that Americans are learning to live parched. The fastest-growing beverage category is tap or filtered water (the biggest losing category: cow's milk and alt-milks). This shift to plain water coincides with a growing body of evidence that sweetened beverages are linked to several lifestyle-related diseases. An October Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity study showed that sugary drinks contribute almost half of added sugars consumed by children, and fruit-flavored drinks are the most common type of sugary drink for young children. Health and nutrition experts recommend that children avoid drinks with added sugars or low-calorie sweeteners, and that caregivers limit children's consumption of 100 percent juice. A study published in JAMA Internal Medicine last week by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco found that a workplace ban on the sale of sugar-sweetened beverages led to a 48.5 percent average reduction in consumption and significantly less belly fat.

Carnival Corp. (CCL, US) was down 1.5%, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH, US) down 2.5%, and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (RCL, US) down 3.5% in trading on Friday afternoon. The State Department reiterated that sentiment on a call with reporters on Friday. â€œThis is a dynamic situation and U.S. citizens traveling by ship may be impacted by travel restrictions affecting their itineraries or ability to disembark, or may be subject to quarantine procedures implemented by the local authorities,â€?the department said in a statement. The Diamond Princess, a ship operated by Carnival that is now docked at a port in Yokohama, Japan, has reported 634 cases and two deaths as a result of the virus. Separately, Carnivalâ€™s Westerdam cruise ship, which eventually docked at Sihanoukville, Cambodia, had been turned away from other ports over concerns of sick passengers. All three cruise line operators have canceled voyages in Asia. Read our full recap of what U.S. companies are saying about COVID-19. The travel industries have been particularly hard by the outbreak as dozens of countries have put into place travel restrictions. A new estimate from the International Air Transport Association predicts that COVID-19 may lead to $29.3 billion in lost revenue for airlines based on a scenario in which this outbreak has a similar impact on air travel demand to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), also a type of coronavirus. Air France-KLM (AF, IT) said Thursday it expects to lose â‚?50 million ($163 million) to â‚?00 million as a result of the outbreak. â€œWe have totally stopped operations to China for both the main and secondary cities,â€?CFO FrÃ©dÃ©ric Gagey told investors on an earnings call. Separately, the Empire State Realty Trust Inc. (ESRT, US), which owns the Empire State Building in New York City, told investors that there are currently only six weekly flights between cities in China and New York City. Chinese tourists accounted for 3% of the companyâ€™s revenue in the first quarter of 2019. The Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board has said it expects to lose $921 million in direct spending from Chinese tourists in 2020. Norwegian, which anticipates losing 75 cents from earnings per share in 2020 after canceling 40 cruises in Asia, told investors on Thursday that customers began canceling cruises outside of Asia after the Diamond Princess was quarantined in Japan. Americans are now choosing to book cruises in Alaska and the Caribbean. â€œYou donâ€™t have to get on an airplane to get to the Caribbean ports,â€?Norwegian CEO Frank Del Rio said on an earnings call. â€œThose seem to be doing better than some of the more exotic or far-flung destinations.â€?COVID-19 was first detected in December in Wuhan, China. The outbreak has largely shut down Hubei Province, home to Wuhan, and slowed or halted factory production and consumer spending across parts of China. The worldwide number of new cases of COVID-19 has continued to slow even as cases in South Korea doubled overnight and Chinaâ€™s Hubei Province updated its figures to include a tally of cases diagnosed among prisoners. There are now 76,785 confirmed cases of and 2,249 deaths, according to the latest figures from the World Health Organization. That is about 1,000 new cases, compared with the 3,000 or so new cases that were being reported daily in early February. Hubei reportedly added 271 infections among prisoners to its tally, a move that prompted questions about whether there are other unreported virus cases in the country, according to The Wall Street Journal. Outside of China, a cluster of infections in South Korea led to the diagnoses of 100 new cases overnight, bringing the total number of cases to 204 there. South Korea has reported one death. In the U.S., there are 34 confirmed cases. That includes 21 people who were repatriated from Asia, including 18 from the Diamond Princess, and another 13 cases, including a new one confirmed Thursday by the Humboldt County health department in California. Hereâ€™s what companies are saying about the impact of COVID-19 on their businesses: â€?Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU, US) said Friday that the majority of its 38 stores in China have been closed since Feb. 3. The yoga gear seller said it continues to â€œmonitor the situationâ€?and will provide an update on the expected financial and operational impact during its fourth-quarter post-earnings conference call in late March. â€?The Coca-Cola Company (KO, US) said Friday it is still expecting to reach its full-year guidance though COVID-19 will likely weigh on first-quarter results. Coca-Cola said it currently estimates an approximate 2- to 3-point impact to unit case volume, 1- to 2-point impact to organic revenue, and 1- to 2-penny impact to earnings per share for the first quarter. The Chinese market makes up 10% of Coca-Colaâ€™s global volume, the company said in January. â€?ITT Inc. (ITT, US) on Friday updated its 2020 guidance, providing a downbeat outlook that included an estimated impact from the outbreak. For 2020, the manufacturer currently expects adjusted EPS of $3.87, and offered a wider range of $3.72 to $4.02, compared with the FactSet consensus of $3.99. â€?Hormel Foods Corp. (HRL, US) expects its international business to have a â€œvery difficultâ€?second quarter as a result of COVID-19. The company said Thursday there has been a slowdown in sales in China, with many restaurants closed, but sales of pantry items like Skippy peanut butter and canned pork Spam have increased. â€œSimilar to other companies in China, all aspects of our in-country supply chain are operating more slowly and at higher cost than normal,â€?CEO James Snee told investors. â€?Dominoâ€™s Pizza Inc. (DPZ, US) said Thursday that fewer than 20 of its stores are closed in China and the outbreak is slowing down the openings of new stores in that market.

Coca-Cola Company (The),KO,2020/6/11,"impacts on communities, occupational health and safety issues, epidemics pandemics, health impact, negligence","Coronavirus Complicated Quest Greener Plastic Bottle; pandemic disrupted recycling hit oil prices, challenging efforts recycled plastic drinks bottles
Several of those target dates came and went unmet this spring as the new coronavirus led to the suspension of some recycling programs, reducing the supplies of used PET, the plastic drinks bottles are made from.
And slumping oil prices have made new plastic far cheaper than recycled, meaning that the cost of making a bottle with recycled plastic  is significantly higher than making one from new plastic.
Coca-Cola missed a self-imposed May deadline to use 50% recycled plastic in all its drinks bottles in the U.K., while Danone failed to hit an April target for its Volvic bottles sold in Germany to be made entirely from recycled plastic.
Despite being easily recyclable, less than a third of PET bottles sold are collected for recycling in the U.S. and just 4% are used to make new drinks bottles, according to the Container Recycling Institute, a nonprofit.
Danone has pledged to make 25% of all its plastic packaging from recycled plastic by 2025, up from 6.4% in 2018, while Coca-Cola plans to achieve 50% recycled content in its bottles and cans by 2030, up from about 10% today.
Companies are also trying to stave off bottled-water bans by highlighting their recycled-plastic efforts.
The Consumer Brands Association, a U.S. trade group whose members include Pepsi and Coca-Cola , is recommending policy makers levy a fee on virgin plastic to finance recycling programs and make recycled material more cost effective.
NestlÃ© , the world's biggest bottled-water maker, in January said it would invest more than 1.5 billion Swiss francs  ($1.58 billion) to pay for food-grade recycled plastic over the next five years.","The quest to make greener plastic bottlesâ€”the core of beverage giants' sustainability effortsâ€”has become harder and more expensive in the pandemic. NestlÃ© SA , Danone SA , Coca-Cola Co . and PepsiCo Inc . all set ambitious targets for using more recycled plastic in their water, soda and juice bottles in a bid to allay consumers' and lawmakers' worries about the environmental impacts of single-use plastic. Several of those target dates came and went unmet this spring as the new coronavirus led to the suspension of some recycling programs, reducing the supplies of used PET, the plastic drinks bottles are made from. And slumping oil prices have made new plastic far cheaper than recycled, meaning that the cost of making a bottle with recycled plastic  is significantly higher than making one from new plastic. Coca-Cola missed a self-imposed May deadline to use 50% recycled plastic in all its drinks bottles in the U.K., while Danone failed to hit an April target for its Volvic bottles sold in Germany to be made entirely from recycled plastic. Danone also missed similar targets in the U.K. and France. Both companies blamed Covid-19 for the delays, and said they hope to meet the goals later this year. The pandemic is exacerbating what was already a tricky problem for drinks companies: getting enough clean, food-grade used plastic to make new bottles. Despite being easily recyclable, less than a third of PET bottles sold are collected for recycling in the U.S. and just 4% are used to make new drinks bottles, according to the Container Recycling Institute, a nonprofit. More than 100 municipalities in the U.S. halted curbside recycling programs as the pandemic struck, while nine out of 10 states with deposit programsâ€”where shoppers get cash back for returning containersâ€”have suspended requirements for retailers to participate. ""Our analysis is that the industry will fall far short of collecting enough bottles to meet their requirement,"" said Michael Bermish, a senior consultant at chemicals and energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. ""There is a huge gap."" Coca-Cola Chief Executive James Quincey said in April the squeeze on recycled plastic would be temporary. ""Maybe we'll have to make adjustments to the process, but it will resume,"" he said. Danone , Coca-Cola and others were already racing to meet their global goals for using greener plastic. Danone has pledged to make 25% of all its plastic packaging from recycled plastic by 2025, up from 6.4% in 2018, while Coca-Cola plans to achieve 50% recycled content in its bottles and cans by 2030, up from about 10% today. Such efforts have been set back by a year at least, according to Scott Mouw, senior director of strategy and research for the Recycling Partnership, a nonprofit. He says some legislation aimed at spurring recycling has been delayed and expects pressure on U.S. municipal budgets to hit existing programs. A Washington state bill mandating drinks containers use at least 10% recycled content by 2022â€”a move widely expected to spur investment in recyclingâ€”was vetoed by Gov. Jay Inslee in April due to budget constraints caused by the pandemic. A container-deposit program in Scotland has been delayed by over a year. Companies have failed to hit sustainability targets before, but executives say this time there is more at stake. The efforts, announced with much fanfare, are being tracked by independent organizations. European Union rules call for countries to achieve a 90% collection rate for plastic bottles by 2029 and use 25% recycled plastic in bottles by 2025, and there could be consequences for not doing so. Companies are also trying to stave off bottled-water bans by highlighting their recycled-plastic efforts. ""People don't want to be seen with a plastic bottle anymore, and recycled plastic is a much more acceptableâ€”in terms of social normsâ€”solution,"" Danone CEO Emmanuel Faber told investors earlier this year. Drinks companies have explored alternatives. Efforts with plant-based plastics  have largely stalled, while chemical recycling technologies , which promise to turn even dirty and colored plastic into clear, food-grade material, remain expensive and niche. For now, collecting, washing and melting old bottles to make new ones is the best way to produce more sustainable bottles, executives say. The costs of making those bottles have been rising for some time, and the current oil-price slump has made new, or virgin, plastic cheaper, increasing the price gap. In Europe, recycled plastic cost 95% more than new plastic in May, up from 35% a year earlier, according to data from Wood Mackenize. In the U.S., the premium has risen to 22% from 7%. The Consumer Brands Association, a U.S. trade group whose members include Pepsi and Coca-Cola , is recommending policy makers levy a fee on virgin plastic to finance recycling programs and make recycled material more cost effective. It says U.S. supplies of recycled plastic meet only 6% of current demand. Drinks companies have so far shown willingness to pay higher prices. NestlÃ© , the world's biggest bottled-water maker, in January said it would invest more than 1.5 billion Swiss francs  ($1.58 billion) to pay for food-grade recycled plastic over the next five years. Yet smaller beverage companies might not be able to afford to use recycled content in their packaging, waste-reduction advocates say. ""For them the question is 'Do I try to increase recycled content or do I go for virgin which is so incredibly cheap?',"" says Sander Defruyt, who works on plastics issues at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation , a nonprofit. Jason Farahnik, director of brand partnerships at CarbonLITE Industries LLC, says the plastics recycler is having fewer conversations with new customers who had set targets but hadn't initiated plans to source material. ""New entrants to the marketplace have slowed down,"" he said.

On Friday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined in a livestream several steps he said the social network will take ahead of the 2020 presidential election to combat hate speech. Among the planned steps: pushing back against voter suppression, boosting standards for hateful content in ads, and labeling content deemed newsworthy. Facebook's policies surrounding divisive posts have been scrutinized after the platform left published a post from President Donald Trump following protests over the death of George Floyd. In the post, Trump said ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts."" Zuckerberg has defended leaving the post untouched, saying Facebook should allow for as much free expression as possible. A similar post published to Twitter carried a warning the tweet was ""glorifying violence."" ""I'm optimistic that we can make progress on public health and racial justice while maintaining our democratic traditions around free expression and voting,"" wrote Zuckerberg Friday. ""I'm committed to making sure Facebook is a force for good on this journey."" How much the campaign hurts Facebook depends on how many companies get involved. ""If we're limited to 10 to 15 big-name advertisers who join the boycott, I think it's more symbolic and it would have limited impact on Facebook's business."" said Baird analyst Colin Sebastian. ""The fear is that this snowballs into something much larger."" Last week, during a speech at Cannes Lion Live, Marc Pritchard, chief brand officer for P&G, said the company would conduct a ""comprehensive review"" of where it is advertising. ""Where standards of responsibility and civility are not met, we will stop our spending, just like weâ€™ve done before,"" he said. Among the steps outlined by Zuckerberg Friday: posts that would typically violate its policies but remain on the platform will include a label noting the content they are sharing may violate their policies. He also said the company would not provide any exemptions to content that incites violence or suppresses voting. ""Even if a politician or government official says it, if we determine that content may lead to violence or deprive people of their right to vote, we will take that content down,"" he said. ""Similarly, there are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I'm announcing here today."" ""People can agree or disagree on where we should draw the line, but I hope they understand our overall philosophy is that it is better to have this discussion out in the open, especially when the stakes are so high,"" Zuckerberg said earlier this month. The decision prompted outcry from both current and former employees urging more action. Several employees went on Twitter to protest the decision, while a group of former Facebook employees wrote an open letter published by The New York Times calling the company's move ""cowardly."" Zuckerberg said Friday Facebook plans to expand what qualifies as hateful content in ads, prohibiting ""claims that people from a specific race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, gender identity or immigration status are a threat to the physical safety, health or survival of others.""

As restaurants ditch self-serve soda fountains, Coca-Cola is linking machines to people's phones. On Monday, Coca-Cola announced that it is rolling out an update to its Freestyle machine that allows customers to choose and pour drinks via smartphone â€?making it a touchless soda fountain. ""No sector has been more damaged or hurt by the pandemic than the restaurant and entertainment business,"" Chris Hellmann, Coca-Cola Freestyle vice president, told Business Insider. People can pour drinks simply by scanning the QR code on the Freestyle machine, without having to download an app or create an account. The beverage options then appear on the phone screen, allowing people to control what they want to pour into their cups. The entire process takes just a few seconds. There are roughly 52,000 Coca-Cola Freestyle machines in the US. According to Hellmann, Coca-Cola plans to roll out touchless technology to 50 machines this week, roughly 10,000 by the end of the summer, and have all Freestyle machines using touchless technology by the end of the year. Many restaurants shut down soda fountains due to the pandemic Most major chains â€?including McDonald's, Popeyes, and Burger King â€?have shut down their self-serve soda fountains as part of safety precautions due to the coronavirus pandemic. As restaurants reopen dining rooms, high-touch surfaces such as beverage dispensers and condiment stations remain off limits. Coca-Cola is also currently working on touchless options for legacy dispensers, Hellmann said. The soda giant has also worked with restaurants to provide other pandemic era safety options, such as hand sanitizer and disposable stylus pens. While Hellmann said that restaurants have been ""hungry"" for a touch-free soda fountain, he emphasized it is still unclear on how people will react to the updated Freestyle. ""I'm not sure how much we're going to see consumers use it,"" Hellmann said. ""And I'm okay with that."" ""This could be very common, and consumers might be very comfortable and want to use it all the time, or it could be a small part of our business,"" Hellmann added.

Coca-Cola Company (The),KO,2021/3/28,"discrimination in employment, social discrimination, racism racial inequality","Coca-Cola C.E.O.: Voting Rights Advocate?
When James Quincey became chief executive of Coca-Cola in 2017, itâ€™s fair to say he wasnâ€™t focused on how to articulate the companyâ€™s position on the issue of voting rights.
Instead, Mr. Quincey, who grew up in Birmingham, England, and has spent most of his career outside the United States, was consumed with the usual C.E.O. fare â€?expanding the business, keeping the share price up and not damaging the brand.
But in a measure of just how much politics has permeated big business these days, Mr. Quincey is now embroiled in a fierce debate over a wave of Republican legislation that would effectively make it harder for people to vote, including many Black voters, in some states.
As one such law made its way through the Georgia legislature in recent weeks, activists began to call on Coca-Cola, which has its headquarters in Atlanta, to publicly oppose the proposed law.
Though the company doesnâ€™t have a history of weighing in on voting rights one way or another, big companies have become increasingly drawn into social and political conversations in recent years.
Coca-Cola ultimately issued a carefully worded statement saying that â€œvoting is a foundational right in Americaâ€?and pledging to â€œwork to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country.â€?But it didnâ€™t publicly weigh in on the legislation before Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed it into law last Thursday.
The companyâ€™s cautious response drew protests and calls for a boycott from activists, who wanted Coca-Cola, along with other major Georgia companies like Delta Air Lines, to speak out against the new law.
Dell and American Airlines publicly condemned a restrictive voting bill being advanced in Texas, and Major League Baseball said it would move the All-Star Game from Atlanta in protest of the new law.
Hours after the Black executives made their statement, Mr. Quincey forcefully came out against the Georgia law for the first time.
â€œThe Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.â€?The statement was welcomed by activists, though many said it was too little, too late.
Laws similar to the one just passed in Georgia have been proposed in nearly every state, and, in part to combat that, Congress is working on a sweeping bill that would reform voting rights nationwide.
Already, activists dissatisfied with the companyâ€™s response in Georgia are pressing the company to do more around the country, while conservatives call on Coca-Cola, and Mr. Quincey, to stay out of politics.
Work needs to be done to make this a step forward, not a step backward, in terms of broader access to voting, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to continue to advocate for as we go into this next phase.
If you go back historically, federal oversight of changing the voting processes in the states has been an important process to make sure that things move forward, not backward.
Do you see a double standard between the way in which companies are engaging with the issue of voting rights and how theyâ€™ve engaged with other issues, be it L.G.B.T. bills or climate change, or immigration, in the past?
Weâ€™re very clear on the importance of diversity and inclusion to the Coca-Cola Company, which aspires to be a brand for everyone, and particularly in the South, given its history.
Thereâ€™s a huge number of stakeholders who want to tell you what to do, and many of them donâ€™t work in the business.
Is Coca-Cola working to diversify away from sugar-heavy drinks?
But whatâ€™s our role in a problem where people are consuming too many calories and too much sugar?","When James Quincey became chief executive of Coca-Cola in 2017, itâ€™s fair to say he wasnâ€™t focused on how to articulate the companyâ€™s position on the issue of voting rights.

Though the company doesnâ€™t have a history of weighing in on voting rights one way or another, big companies have become increasingly drawn into social and political conversations in recent years. As a vote on the law drew near, Mr. Quincey was under pressure to pick a side. Coca-Cola ultimately issued a carefully worded statement saying that â€œvoting is a foundational right in Americaâ€?and pledging to â€œwork to advance voting rights and access in Georgia and across the country.â€?But it didnâ€™t publicly weigh in on the legislation before Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed it into law last Thursday. The companyâ€™s cautious response drew protests and calls for a boycott from activists, who wanted Coca-Cola, along with other major Georgia companies like Delta Air Lines, to speak out against the new law. More than 70 prominent Black executives called on corporations to do more to protect voting rights. As the week went on, more companies and even sports leagues spoke out. Dell and American Airlines publicly condemned a restrictive voting bill being advanced in Texas, and Major League Baseball said it would move the All-Star Game from Atlanta in protest of the new law. Hours after the Black executives made their statement, Mr. Quincey forcefully came out against the Georgia law for the first time. â€œI want to be crystal clear,â€?he said. â€œThe Coca-Cola Company does not support this legislation, as it makes it harder for people to vote, not easier.â€?The statement was welcomed by activists, though many said it was too little, too late. Yet at the same time, Mr. Quinceyâ€™s words drew the ire of prominent conservatives, with Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the Fox News host Laura Ingraham and Stephen Miller, an adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, attacking the company on Twitter. Laws similar to the one just passed in Georgia have been proposed in nearly every state, and, in part to combat that, Congress is working on a sweeping bill that would reform voting rights nationwide. Already, activists dissatisfied with the companyâ€™s response in Georgia are pressing the company to do more around the country, while conservatives call on Coca-Cola, and Mr. Quincey, to stay out of politics. It was another illustration, as if one was needed, of how the political polarization straining the country is creating fault lines in corporate America, with big brands caught in the middle. The following was condensed and edited from two conversations, the second of which took place six days after the Georgia law was passed. You waited six days after the Georgia law was passed to criticize it. What changed? What changed is the legislation passed. The process was curtailed, was rushed, was not profound enough, and the resulting legislation is unacceptable, and it needs to be corrected. Work needs to be done to make this a step forward, not a step backward, in terms of broader access to voting, and thatâ€™s what weâ€™re going to continue to advocate for as we go into this next phase. Whatever we were doing before was not getting through. People are misconstruing, by honest error or willfully, what we have stood for and what weâ€™re trying to do. Obviously they could disagree whether you should do more or less in private and public. But thereâ€™s enough stories out there saying the opposite of what weâ€™ve actually said and believe in. We have to go and correct that at the very minimum, and most importantly, we need to generate some clarity that weâ€™re going to continue to advocate against this bill. Do you regret not coming out against the law more forcefully before the law was actually signed by Governor Kemp? No one in the legislature was under any illusion as to our views on the various drafts or even the final law. They knew. Would it have made any difference if we had said anything publicly? Weâ€™ll never know. If we could have done something in retrospect to have made a different outcome, of course, we would have preferred to have done it. Because we donâ€™t like the outcome. Similar bills are being advanced in more than 40 other states. How far will Coca-Cola go to oppose them? Weâ€™re a Georgia-based company. Thatâ€™s going to be certainly our starting point. I donâ€™t see us having the wherewithal to understand every nuance in every other state. I think there will be energy directed at the federal level. If you go back historically, federal oversight of changing the voting processes in the states has been an important process to make sure that things move forward, not backward. Do you see a double standard between the way in which companies are engaging with the issue of voting rights and how theyâ€™ve engaged with other issues, be it L.G.B.T. bills or climate change, or immigration, in the past? Itâ€™s not that the corporate community was not involved. We were perhaps not as public as some people wish we had been, or perhaps would have made more difference. Youâ€™ve got this tension of getting companies involved â€?the tension of dragging, or having companies pulled, into politics. When do I get involved? You canâ€™t possibly be involved in every issue. So getting clear on what are the most important things to your company is what we go back to. Weâ€™re very clear on the importance of diversity and inclusion to the Coca-Cola Company, which aspires to be a brand for everyone, and particularly in the South, given its history. We stand for diversity and inclusion in Georgia above all else, and thatâ€™s why we came to the table on this issue. We tried to effect change. It didnâ€™t work. But we have not given up by any stretch of the imagination. You had lots of senior roles before becoming C.E.O. What is the biggest difference as C.E.O.? When you become C.E.O. you think youâ€™ve got this organizational pyramid and youâ€™ve come at the apex, and now everyone works for you. But then you find out thereâ€™s another pyramid, but itâ€™s upside down, and youâ€™re the one person at the bottom. Thereâ€™s a huge number of stakeholders who want to tell you what to do, and many of them donâ€™t work in the business. So you deal with the board, the media, the investors, the analysts, the NGOs, the government. You have this whole galaxy of people you need to deal with in a way that was never true for any of the other jobs. If you havenâ€™t gotten really clear on what are the few things that I want to tell people about and prioritize things this, it can be quite destabilizing. Does the soda industry have a reputation problem? The first step is to realize that somethingâ€™s going wrong. When youâ€™re a famous brand and a famous company, issues get brought to your door every day. If you want to get attention to something, calling it Cokeâ€™s fault, or thinking that Coke could help us get this fixed, is much easier than doing that with Acme, Inc., who no oneâ€™s heard of. That doesnâ€™t mean we should bury our heads in the sand. We need to look at them and work out, whether we agree itâ€™s a real problem, and what are we in favor of as part of the solution? We canâ€™t solve everything. Is Coca-Cola working to diversify away from sugar-heavy drinks? The starting point is: What does the consumer really want? They want great tasting drinks. And whatâ€™s the consequence of some of that? The total food and beverage diet is delivering too many calories and too much sugar. You can get that answer from any health professional. OK. So are we going to tell the consumers what to drink? Are we going to restrict them? We still want to grow our business. But whatâ€™s our role in a problem where people are consuming too many calories and too much sugar? We need to get our sugar footprint, for want of a better expression, to go down. We need the business to grow because if we just sign up to a shrinking business, thereâ€™ll be a shareholder revolt. We have to sign up to a growing business with a shrinking sugar footprint. What does that require? Well, it requires us to drive the zero calorie products. It requires us to drive into smaller package sizes. And we need to innovate in drinks that are inherently lower calorie or lower sugar. If we do that, we can actually grow the business and reduce the sugar footprint. How has the pandemic changed consumer habits? Half our business is away from home. So with the cinemas closed, the airlines, the hotels, you can see how much itâ€™s down. But what did grow, because people were obliged effectively to spend more time at home, was a resurgence in breakfast. We used to all get up and rush out of apartments to go to work, and many people skip breakfast. Well, now they have more time for it. So juice sales were up.","<Incident Category>: discrimination in employment, social discrimination, racism racial inequality

Coca-Cola Company (The),KO,2021/8/10,human rights abuses and corporate complicity,"Carbon Liter Coke? Companies Grapple Climate Change Math; Investors regulators increasingly businesses affect climate
From farm to bottler to supermarket cooler, a liter of Coca-Cola creates 346 grams of carbon dioxide emissions, the company's data show.
Within the next couple of years, every public company in the U.S. might well be required to report climate information.
U.S. and European regulators already demand or are expected to require that public companies disclose their greenhouse-gas emissions.
Regulators also want better disclosure of climate-related risks for public companies.
The SEC is working on a potential climate-disclosure regulation and has sought public comment.
Countries in Europe already require that companies doing business there honor governments' demands for climate disclosures.
The SEC and other regulators say climate change poses specific risks to companies that investors should be told about.
Rating firms use the company information to help create ESG grades widely followed by investors.
A BlackRock spokesman said, ""We also offer funds that provide targeted exposure to specific sustainable outcomes or some that screen out fossil fuel companies along with a range of other industries."" Another headache for investors trying to pick green stocks is the variation in how companies report climate information.
Its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, which owns utilities and coal plants, said in a three-page sustainability report: ""We strive to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions."" It put no date on the target.
A P&G spokeswoman said the footprint for its product was based on ""general data not specific to P&G supply chains, manufacturing, or disposal."" A spokesman for the Environmental Paper Network said its calculator, which uses industry averages, is ""a science-based, trusted, independent tool."" Greenhouse-gas emissions fall into three categories, according to a widely used international framework.
Energy company EOG Resources Inc. said in its 2019 sustainability report it ""does not believe that it is able to calculate Scope 3 emissions with the accuracy and rigor typically required for EOG's publicly reported data."" Coca-Cola, in figuring emissions from employee business travel, looks at flights only; Verizon Communications Inc. includes air and rail travel; AT&T Inc. counts emissions from employees' air, rail and car travel and is looking at adding travel with ride-share companies.
The SEC's Mr. Gensler said in his speech last week he has asked staff to recommend how companies might disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, ""along with whether to disclose Scope 3 emissionsâ€”and if so, how and under what circumstances."" The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit standards setter that is widely followed, says climate risk is likely to significantly affect 68 out of 77 of the industry categories it counts, equating to 89% of the market value of S&P Global 1200 companies, or roughly $45.2 trillion.
Companies would take climate disclosure more seriously, and it would be more accurate, if it were mandated and checked by an outsider, said Rick Love, who retired last year as director of environmental sustainability at United Technologies Corp.
soon after it merged with Raytheon Co. If emissions had to be reported in proxy statements or financial accounts, he said, he would have to vouch for the data to company attorneys.
A Journal review of climate reporting by the 50 largest companies in the S&P 500 found most used an outside auditor for some of the data they voluntarily reported, but verification was significantly less thorough than for financial statements.
Mr. Gensler said in his speech last week that he has asked agency staff to prepare proposed rules for mandatory climate-risk disclosure by the end of the year.
Some companies saw required climate disclosure as a solution to unrelenting requests they get from big investors and rating firms for ESG data.
SEC officials have said they are considering creating a new standards-setter for ESG disclosures, along the lines of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a body that would have expertise in matters like climate science, alternative energy and environmental risks.
The SEC, which was created to protect investors, typically regulates publicly traded companies.
Some investors and companies want it to apply climate disclosure rules to private companies, too, saying that otherwise it would be harder for public companies to report on emissions generated by suppliers and customers.","From farm to bottler to supermarket cooler, a liter of Coca-Cola creates 346 grams of carbon dioxide emissions, the company's data show. That's less than half the tree-to-toilet 771-gram carbon footprint of a mega roll of Charmin Ultra Soft toilet paper, as measured by the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Math like this is fast becoming obligatory. Investors are increasing pressure on businesses to disclose the emissions of greenhouse gases related to their products and services. Regulators are starting to ask about that, too. Within the next couple of years, every public company in the U.S. might well be required to report climate information. Such an effort would be the biggest potential expansion in corporate disclosure since the creation of the Depression-era rules over financial disclosures that underpin modern corporate statements. Already it has kicked off a confusing melee as companies, regulators and environmentalists argue over the proper way to account for carbon. U.S. and European regulators already demand or are expected to require that public companies disclose their greenhouse-gas emissions. That might include the emissions produced by their suppliers and customers. Regulators also want better disclosure of climate-related risks for public companies. These can range from physical ones such as effects from extreme weather to financial risks such as if a fossil-fuel asset like a coal mine loses value. ""When it comes to disclosure, investors have told us what they want,"" Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said in a speech last week. ""It's now time for the commission to take the baton."" The demands from some investors for more and better climate-related information carry increasing weight as ""green"" financial products surge in popularity. Some $51 billion poured into sustainable U.S. mutual funds and exchange-traded funds last year, according to data provider Morningstar Inc. That was almost 10 times the level of 2018 and represented nearly a quarter of the cash that went into all U.S. stock and bond funds last year, Morningstar said. The SEC is working on a potential climate-disclosure regulation and has sought public comment. It has the backing of the White House, which has called for drastic cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions. Countries in Europe already require that companies doing business there honor governments' demands for climate disclosures. The SEC and other regulators say climate change poses specific risks to companies that investors should be told about. Among them is the risk that companies producing a lot of greenhouse gases could be avoided by some lenders, insurers or investors, either because those parties see the companies as harming the environment or because they view the companies' businesses as vulnerable. A scientific panel working under the auspices of the United Nations stated in a report Monday that effects of a warming climate are unequivocally driven by greenhouse-gas emissions from human activity. Like calorie counts on menus, the climate data would be designed to help buyers of shares know what they are getting. And, say proponents of required disclosure, a U.S. mandate would standardize what is now a confusing mishmash. Corporations already pump out forests-worth of environmental data voluntarily. They are responding to requests for information from investors interested in businesses that have good environmental, social and governance, or ESG, records. Rating firms use the company information to help create ESG grades widely followed by investors. Currently, the ratings are inconsistent and incomplete, an indication of the work that lies ahead. A Wall Street Journal analysis of ESG grades issued for nearly 1,500 companies by three rating firms found that nearly two-thirdsâ€?42 companiesâ€”got different grades from different raters. The Journal collected ratings from the websites of three prominent ratings firms in Mayâ€”Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., MSCI Inc. and Sustainalyticsâ€”and identified 1,469 companies scored by all three. Nearly a third of the companies were deemed ESG leaders by one or more rating firms, but labeled ESG laggards by one or another rater. Credit ratings, by contrast, are broadly consistent. Oil giant Chevron Corp. earned top marks for ""excellent relative ESG performance"" from Refinitiv, a unit of London Stock Exchange Group PLC. MSCI gave Chevron an average rating. And Chevron got a worst-possible ""severe risk"" grade from Sustainalytics, owned by Morningstar. One reason for the difference: The Refinitiv score put more weight on social issues, such as workforce diversity, than on Chevron's fossil-fuels dependence, the Journal's analysis showed. ""All ratings providers are measuring different things,"" said Julia Giguere-Morello, ESG research director at MSCI. ""Some are much more risk-focused, some are impact-focused, some are values-based."" Lisa Epifani, Chevron's ESG and sustainability manager, said ESG scores should ""come with a bit of a warning"" that different methodologies can lead to widely varying scores. A single overall ESG score ""could paint a very imprecise picture of a company,"" she said. Some green funds own companies with poor ESG scores from at least one rater. BlackRock Inc.'s iShares ESG Aware MSCI USA exchange-traded fund owns Chevron shares. A BlackRock spokesman said, ""We also offer funds that provide targeted exposure to specific sustainable outcomes or some that screen out fossil fuel companies along with a range of other industries."" Another headache for investors trying to pick green stocks is the variation in how companies report climate information. Most of the biggest 500 U.S. public companies produce annual sustainability reports. The glossy documents share a taste for photos of happy employees and blooming plants. The quality and breadth of their data differ significantly, and little is audited. Twitter Inc., which says it wants to be ""good stewards to our planet,"" doesn't disclose its greenhouse-gas emissions or give a numerical target for reducing them. It says it will set a target within two years. Meanwhile, Twitter highlights efforts it has made such as removing 70,000 plastic toothbrushes from its offices. By contrast, Microsoft Corp.'s 96-page data-heavy report breaks down its emissions into more than a dozen categories, including those resulting from energy consumption, transportation, employee commuting and the use and disposal of its products. A Twitter spokeswoman declined to comment. Microsoft said it is ""committed to transparency on sustainability."" Berkshire Hathaway Inc., led by Warren Buffett, stands out for the paucity of its disclosure. It doesn't report overall climate-related risks. Its Berkshire Hathaway Energy unit, which owns utilities and coal plants, said in a three-page sustainability report: ""We strive to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions."" It put no date on the target. Cathy Woollums, chief sustainability officer at Berkshire Hathaway Energy, said it plans to close all coal-fueled units and to have ""minimal"" greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. declined to comment. Tesla Inc. discloses the life-cycle emissions of a Model 3 car but not emissions for the company as a whole. Procter & Gamble releases carbon dioxide data companywide but not for individual products. Coca-Cola Co. until recently set a yearly target for reducing ""drink in your hand"" carbon dioxide emissions related to the production, sale and consumption of a single one of its drinks. It has since switched to a goal of reducing total emissions. In figuring the carbon footprint of P&G's Charmin Ultra Soft, the environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council used a calculator from a green advocacy group called the Environmental Paper Network. A P&G spokeswoman said the footprint for its product was based on ""general data not specific to P&G supply chains, manufacturing, or disposal."" A spokesman for the Environmental Paper Network said its calculator, which uses industry averages, is ""a science-based, trusted, independent tool."" Greenhouse-gas emissions fall into three categories, according to a widely used international framework. Those resulting from company operations are called Scope 1. There also are Scope 2 emissions, resulting from energy the company buys. For some companies, the most troublesome to figure are Scope 3: emissions that are related to their products but produced by their employees, suppliers and customers, such as during suppliers' transportation. These are a ""tremendous challenge"" to measure, Walt Disney Co. said in a recent report on its 2030 environmental goals, but it aims to start reporting them by the end of next year nonetheless. Energy company EOG Resources Inc. said in its 2019 sustainability report it ""does not believe that it is able to calculate Scope 3 emissions with the accuracy and rigor typically required for EOG's publicly reported data."" Coca-Cola, in figuring emissions from employee business travel, looks at flights only; Verizon Communications Inc. includes air and rail travel; AT&T Inc. counts emissions from employees' air, rail and car travel and is looking at adding travel with ride-share companies. Ben Jordan, senior director of environmental policy at Coca-Cola, said for a global corporation, air travel is much more significant than any other mode. Verizon said it plans to expand its reporting to emissions from rental cars, taxis and hotels. AT&T declined to comment. The SEC's Mr. Gensler said in his speech last week he has asked staff to recommend how companies might disclose their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, ""along with whether to disclose Scope 3 emissionsâ€”and if so, how and under what circumstances."" The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit standards setter that is widely followed, says climate risk is likely to significantly affect 68 out of 77 of the industry categories it counts, equating to 89% of the market value of S&P Global 1200 companies, or roughly $45.2 trillion. Some asset managers say they seek climate data because they want to invest in businesses that can adapt to climate change. ""Our goal to de-risk our client portfolios,"" said Jonathan Bailey, head of ESG investing at Neuberger Berman Group LLC. Companies would take climate disclosure more seriously, and it would be more accurate, if it were mandated and checked by an outsider, said Rick Love, who retired last year as director of environmental sustainability at United Technologies Corp. soon after it merged with Raytheon Co. If emissions had to be reported in proxy statements or financial accounts, he said, he would have to vouch for the data to company attorneys. ""If you really want data that's reliable, having it being something that's auditable strikes me as being a basic requirement,"" Mr. Love said. A Journal review of climate reporting by the 50 largest companies in the S&P 500 found most used an outside auditor for some of the data they voluntarily reported, but verification was significantly less thorough than for financial statements. The SEC appears determined to use its rule-making power to impose order on the free for all. Mr. Gensler said in his speech last week that he has asked agency staff to prepare proposed rules for mandatory climate-risk disclosure by the end of the year. At a Wall Street Journal CFO Network event in June, Mr. Gensler said it was appropriate for the SEC to help ""bring consistency, some comparability, and reliability"" by mandating disclosures. The challenge for regulators is to write rules that would hold up over time in a new and rapidly changing area. They can't go too far because the effort is already facing political opposition from some Republicans arguing it isn't the SEC's job to mandate nonfinancial disclosures. But they feel they need to go far enough so the U.S. isn't left behind as international regulators issue rules that will apply to many American companies. Another regulatory challenge is devising disclosures that would be transparent, accurate and universal across a wide range of industries. ""It's a monumental task. It's unlikely the first cut at this will be perfect,"" said Robert Jackson, a former SEC commissioner who is now a law professor at New York University. An SEC request for comments on how it should proceed drew more than 550 responses. Three out of four backed mandatory disclosure, according to Mr. Gensler's speech. Some companies saw required climate disclosure as a solution to unrelenting requests they get from big investors and rating firms for ESG data. These create ""a myriad of cumbersome and time-consuming commitments for companies,"" Uber Technologies Inc. told the SEC. Apple Inc. and Walmart Inc. were among companies echoing Uber's call for compulsory reporting and standards. A plea from some businesses, though, was for protection from lawsuits in case their climate data or forecasts prove wrong. SEC officials have said they are considering this. Some industry bodies, including the U.S. Oil and Gas Association and Western Energy Alliance, told the SEC it didn't have legal authority to compel disclosures and impose its value judgments. And Patrick Morrisey, West Virginia's Republican attorney general, wrote that ""West Virginia will not permit the unconstitutional politicization of the Securities and Exchange Commission. If you choose to pursue this course we will defeat it in court."" The legal threat is unlikely to deter the agency, according to Harvey Pitt, a former SEC chairman. ""Whether or not the litigation will succeed will depend on how aggressive the SEC's rule-making turns out to be,"" he said. Share Your Thoughts How would mandated corporate disclosure of climate data change the business landscape? Join the conversation below. SEC officials say they want to move as fast as possible, not least because of actions other countries are taking. Some U.S. companies selling into Europe and elsewhere must comply with overseas rules. This year alone, the European Union, U.K., Switzerland and China have proposed or finalized green-reporting rules, affecting tens of thousands of companies. The Group of Seven leading rich countries called in June for mandatory climate-related financial disclosures. SEC officials have said they are considering creating a new standards-setter for ESG disclosures, along the lines of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a body that would have expertise in matters like climate science, alternative energy and environmental risks. The SEC, which was created to protect investors, typically regulates publicly traded companies. Some investors and companies want it to apply climate disclosure rules to private companies, too, saying that otherwise it would be harder for public companies to report on emissions generated by suppliers and customers. Others argue the SEC lacks legal power to impose the requirement on private companies.

Some of the world's biggest consumer-goods companies agreed to change their U.S. recycling labels for some products after reaching a settlement with an anti-plastic group that said they misled shoppers about the scope of a recycling initiative.
Earlier this year, Last Beach Cleanup, a nonprofit that criticizes companies for plastic waste and poor recycling practices, filed a lawsuit in California against recycling startup TerraCycle Inc. and eight companies it works with, including Procter & Gamble Co. and Coca-Cola Co., alleging that consumers weren't told about limits on TerraCycle programs that meant their waste might not get recycled.
Amid a backlash over plastic waste, TerraCycle has grown fast by signing up companies that pay it to collect and recycle packaging and single-use products.
On Nov. 5, Last Beach Cleanup entered into a settlement with TerraCycle and eight companies that it works with to recycle packaging for certain products.
Under the settlement, TerraCycle and its partner companies agreed to notify consumers if there is a limit to how many people can sign up due to funding constraints, for instance by including a disclaimer on the packaging saying ""Limited Availability."" They also agreed not to label products that are part of TerraCycle's program as ""100% recyclable,"" and TerraCycle will enlist a third party to verify what happens to the waste it collects and share the information with Last Beach Cleanup and the companies.
Mr. Szaky said all the Terracycle-branded products the company receives are recycled.
TerraCycle has higher recycling rates for hard-to-recycle materials than conventional waste management companies, he said, in part because the funding from brands means it can operate outside of the traditional industry.","Some of the world's biggest consumer-goods companies agreed to change their U.S. recycling labels for some products after reaching a settlement with an anti-plastic group that said they misled shoppers about the scope of a recycling initiative.

Amid a backlash over plastic waste, TerraCycle has grown fast by signing up companies that pay it to collect and recycle packaging and single-use products. It works with more than 50 brands to collect specific hard-to-recycle items and turn them into new goods, for instance, turning toothbrushes into building materials. TerraCycle collects fees from companies based on how much waste is collected and recycled as well as management fees for setting up and running the programs. Its labels appear on packages for products such as Gerber baby food, Febreze air freshener and Burt's Bees cosmetics. Consumers who want to recycle their waste have to sign up online before sending it to TerraCycle at no cost to them or leaving it at drop-off locations. On Nov. 5, Last Beach Cleanup entered into a settlement with TerraCycle and eight companies that it works with to recycle packaging for certain products. In addition to P&G and Coke, Campbell Soup Co.-owned Late July Snacks, Clorox Co., Colgate-Palmolive Co.-owned Tom's of Maine, Groupe Mom-owned Materne North America, L'OrÃ©al North America, and NestlÃ© SA-owned Gerber Products Co., were part of the settlement. TerraCycle Chief Executive Tom Szaky said what the consumer-goods companies agree to pay sometimes only covers a limited amount of waste. When that happens, people who try to sign up online may be put on a waiting list. Under the settlement, TerraCycle and its partner companies agreed to notify consumers if there is a limit to how many people can sign up due to funding constraints, for instance by including a disclaimer on the packaging saying ""Limited Availability."" They also agreed not to label products that are part of TerraCycle's program as ""100% recyclable,"" and TerraCycle will enlist a third party to verify what happens to the waste it collects and share the information with Last Beach Cleanup and the companies. TerraCycle's CEO said it was already planning to sign up an auditor. The labelling requirements need to be met by the end of this year and October 2022. Auditing begins next year, but a summary report won't need to be provided until January 2023. The lawsuit underscores the challenge of recycling plastic waste, despite demand for environmentally friendly products. Representatives for Clorox, Gerber, Tom's of Maine and P&G said they would continue to work with TerraCycle. Coke and Campbell declined to comment. L'OrÃ©al didn't respond to requests for comment. Mom Group couldn't be reached for comment. The lawsuit also said it was ""hard to believe"" TerraCycle's claimed recycling rates for the waste it collects, citing much lower industrywide recycling rates. Mr. Szaky said all the Terracycle-branded products the company receives are recycled. TerraCycle has higher recycling rates for hard-to-recycle materials than conventional waste management companies, he said, in part because the funding from brands means it can operate outside of the traditional industry. TerraCycle uses third-party processors, but it operates its own sorting centers and in some cases develops its own recycling technology. ""We are not traditional recycling,"" he said. In a press release announcing the settlement, Last Beach Cleanup cited the documentary ""The Recycling Myth,"" which allegedly showed waste that TerraCycle collected being sent to a cement kiln in Bulgaria to be incinerated. Mr. Szaky said the waste was never incinerated. It was sent to a recycler in Bulgaria due to human error and was returned to the U.K. for recycling after it came to the company's attention, he said. TerraCycle committed in the settlement not to incinerate any collected waste, but that promise was ""no big deal,"" Mr. Szaky said. ""We already do it,"" he said. Privately held TerraCycle reported a profit of nearly $3.2 million for the six months to June 30, up from $1.42 million in the year-earlier period. Sales from its sponsored waste program grew to $7.1 million from $5.1 million as it snapped up new clients and took in fees. The company's overall sales were $15.1 million, up from $11.5 million. Last Beach Cleanup was represented by environmental- and consumer-focused legal firm Lexington Law Group, which TerraCycle agreed to pay an undisclosed sum under the settlement.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Coca-Cola Company on Thursday said it will aim for 25% of its packaging globally to be reusable by 2030, a move hailed by environmental groups who have called out the soft-drink maker for worldwide plastic pollution.
Reusable packaging includes containers that can be refilled with original product by companies or consumers, such as refillable fountain drink containers and glass and plastic bottles that are refillable or returnable, the cola maker said, referring to reuse guidelines by nonprofit Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Coca-Cola is a top target for consumer, investor and environmental groups concerned about petroleum-based plastic single-use bottles clogging oceans, among other problems. The company was the world's worst plastic polluter for the fourth year in a row in 2021, according to the global coalition Break Free From Plastic's annual report released in October. ""We hope that other companies will follow Coke's leadership and set reusable packaging targets,"" said the group's global corporate campaign coordinator Emma Priestland. Reusable packaging includes containers that can be refilled with original product by companies or consumers, such as refillable fountain drink containers and glass and plastic bottles that are refillable or returnable, the cola maker said, referring to reuse guidelines by nonprofit Ellen MacArthur Foundation. In 2020, 16% of the company's packaging was reusable. That year, 90% of its refillable glass and plastic containers were collected, it said. Coca-Cola's announcement on Thursday is ""the first known goal of its kind"" and ""a welcome change in strategy,"" fund manager Green Century Capital Management said in a statement. Green Century and activist investor As You Sow filed a shareholder proposal urging Coca-Cola to reduce single-use plastic. They are now considering whether to withdraw their proposal. If Coca-Cola hits its new goal, it will be ""easier to achieve our objectives of a World Without Waste, where we intend to collect back a bottle or can for every one we sell by 2030,"" Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said during the company's fourth quarter earnings call Thursday. Eight in 10 American adults support government policies to reduce single-use plastic, according to a poll released on Wednesday by advocacy group Oceana. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and other international brands in January called for a global pact that included calls to cut plastic production, a key growth area for the oil industry. Break Free From Plastic cleaned beaches in 45 countries and found nearly 20,000 Coca-Cola branded products, more than the next two largest plastic polluters - PepsiCo Inc and Unilever PLC - combined.

Investors have rebuked two dozen major U.S. companies over their executive-pay packages in nonbinding shareholder votes, sometimes by wide margins or for the second straight year.
Seven blue chips came in under 70% for a second year in a row, including General Electric Co. The median pay package in 2021 for chief executive officers of S&P 500 companies was $14.7 million, a sixth straight record, according to The Wall Street Journal's annual analysis.
PHOTO: Sean Pressley for The Wall Street Journal At JPMorgan, 31% of shares were voted in favor of the bank's pay plans, as investors objected to a $50 million retention bonus for CEO Jamie Dimon.
The company awarded him a pay package of $178.6 million for 2021, much of it in stock and option awards that vest over three to five years and are contingent on increases in its share price.
Intel said that Mr. Gelsinger's 2022 target total direct compensation will drop to $26.3 million, though his actual pay package could be larger or smaller depending on company performance.
An Intel spokeswoman said the company has taken steps to address investors' feedback on compensation, although ""clearly there is more work to be done."" She said 73% of Mr. Gelsinger's equity awards are performance-based.
James Quincey, CEO of Coca-Cola, received a pay package valued at $24.9 million in 2021, a 35% increase from the preceding year.
Last year investors criticized special equity awards for top executives during 2020, including a stock grant for CEO Larry Culp that the company initially valued at $57.1 million.
This year, ISS said the company had proved responsive to shareholders' concerns by lowering Mr. Culp's 2022 target equity grant and promising not to adjust performance measures for equity awards that had already been made.","Investors have rebuked two dozen major U.S. companies over their executive-pay packages in nonbinding shareholder votes, sometimes by wide margins or for the second straight year. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Intel Corp. investors owning roughly two-thirds of shares didn't support pay plans at recent annual meetings. Coca-Cola Co. barely won majority support with 50.5% of the vote this year. Historically, it is unusual for companies to get less than 90% support on these votes, and corporate-governance analysts consider less than 70% support to reflect significant investor dissatisfaction. So far, 23 companies in the S&P 500 have reported less than 70% support for their executive-compensation programs, compared with 21 among the same companies a year ago, compensation-data firm Equilar found in an analysis of about 250 companies. Seven blue chips came in under 70% for a second year in a row, including General Electric Co. The median pay package in 2021 for chief executive officers of S&P 500 companies was $14.7 million, a sixth straight record, according to The Wall Street Journal's annual analysis. Stock awards, whose value can rise or fall, accounted for the bulk of the compensation, especially for the highest-paid leaders in the Journal's 2021 rankings. The scrutiny on executive compensation practices is part of a broader trend as investors emphasize environmental, social and corporate-governanceâ€”or ESGâ€”issues, said Sara Mahaffy, ESG strategist for RBC Capital Markets. Her firm estimates that $1.4 trillion in assets globally are managed by stock funds that heavily emphasize ESG criteria when making investment decisions. Nine CEOs got pay packages of at least $50 million last year, compared with one in 2016, according to the Journal's analysis. Such unusual or large one-time awards are drawing more attention, said Caitlin McSherry, director of investment stewardship at the investment manager Neuberger Berman. ""It's something shareholders will be looking for more, the philosophy around one-off awards,"" she said. JPMorgan investors objected to a $50 million retention bonus for CEO Jamie Dimon. PHOTO: Sean Pressley for The Wall Street Journal At JPMorgan, 31% of shares were voted in favor of the bank's pay plans, as investors objected to a $50 million retention bonus for CEO Jamie Dimon. Including the special bonus, Mr. Dimon's 2021 compensation totaled $84.4 million, putting him among the highest-paid CEOs in the S&P 500 for the year. (See the full WSJ ranking.) The bonus is in options that require shares to trade above certain levels and for Mr. Dimon to remain CEO until 2026. The bank and directors said the award was to clarify that Mr. Dimon would remain in his position for several more years. Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass Lewis & Co., two firms that advise shareholders on voting, had both recommended voting against the pay package, because of the retention bonus and a smaller grant given to Daniel Pinto, the president and chief operating officer. ISS said the awards weren't tied closely enough to the bank's performance. The vote isn't binding, and Mr. Dimon isn't expected to return the special award. ""Say on pay"" votes have been mandatory for large U.S.-listed companies since 2011 and are purely advisory. Still, most boards respond to a poor showing by canvassing major investors for their concerns and often tweaking pay packages. Just over a third of Intel shares supported the company's executive pay policies at the annual shareholder meeting on May 12. Last year, 38% did. Intel changed CEOs and brought in Pat Gelsinger in February 2021. The company awarded him a pay package of $178.6 million for 2021, much of it in stock and option awards that vest over three to five years and are contingent on increases in its share price. Intel said the stock awards were based on Mr. Gelsinger's experience, the challenge of leading a turnaround and his forfeiting approximately $50 million in equity awards from his previous job. Intel said that Mr. Gelsinger's 2022 target total direct compensation will drop to $26.3 million, though his actual pay package could be larger or smaller depending on company performance. An Intel spokeswoman said the company has taken steps to address investors' feedback on compensation, although ""clearly there is more work to be done."" She said 73% of Mr. Gelsinger's equity awards are performance-based. At Coca-Cola, shareholder support for its executive-pay program declined sharply, falling to 50.5% from 94% a year ago. ISS said the company didn't adequately explain a special award for CEO James Quincey, valued by the company at about $3.2 million. Mr. Quincey received a pay package valued at $24.9 million in 2021, up 35% from a year earlier. ISS also criticized Coke's decision to pay $9.3 million in cash and consulting fees to the company's former general counsel. Coca-Cola declined to comment.

""Overall, we thought the company had really made an effort to listen to shareholdersâ€”it did take some steps to be responsive,"" said Neuberger Berman's Ms. McSherry. ISS again recommended a ""no"" vote, saying the company's proxy statement provided too little information about a $5 billion adjustment to free cash flow in determining whether the company met performance targets, which increased executive payouts. ISS also called out a decision to measure some performance criteria over one year, instead of three, for some equity awards. A GE spokeswoman referred to the company's securities filings, which said that the company had met with investors holding 52% of shares outstanding and that shareholders were overwhelmingly supportive of Mr. Culp.

For its part, Coca-Cola has a World Without Waste initiative to make 100% of its packaging recyclable and get a bottle back for each one it sells by 2030.
To support that goal, Coca-Cola will make Dasani bottles sold in the US and Canada from 100% recycled plastic, avoiding an estimated 10,000 tons of virgin plastic next year alone.
That is still a small dent in the 3 million tons of plastic Coca-Cola uses each year, which the company has started to scale back mainly by making bottles lighter.","* Coca-Cola ditches green Sprite bottles and switches to clear to be more environmentally friendly. * By October, all green bottles will be phased out, including Fresca and Mello Yello. * The change makes it more likely bottles will be recycled. Say goodbye to the iconic green Sprite bottle. Coca-Cola is transitioning the brand to clear plastic bottles on August 1. By October, the company will do the same for Fresca, Mello Yello, and Seagram's. Turns out, green plastic isn't green in the environmental sense. A colored bottle contaminates the recycling stream and has to be separated out, increasing the chances it ends up in a landfill. There's not a big market for green plastic either, so recyclers can't make much money selling it off to be made into new packaging. ""By making our bottles clear â€?a huge change for the brand â€?it makes them much more likely to go through the recycling system and come back to us as recycled PET,"" said Chris Vallette, senior vice president of technical innovation and stewardship, citing an industry term for the plastic used to make bottles. The change comes as global efforts to eliminate plastic pollution gain steam in countries like the US, Canada, and India to protect oceans and tackle climate change. Japan and South Korea more than two decades ago ended colored plastic to boost recycling and reduce plastic waste. For its part, Coca-Cola has a World Without Waste initiative to make 100% of its packaging recyclable and get a bottle back for each one it sells by 2030. The beverage giant also pledged that half of its packaging will be made from recycled materials in the same timeframe. To support that goal, Coca-Cola will make Dasani bottles sold in the US and Canada from 100% recycled plastic, avoiding an estimated 10,000 tons of virgin plastic next year alone. That is still a small dent in the 3 million tons of plastic Coca-Cola uses each year, which the company has started to scale back mainly by making bottles lighter. Matt Littlejohn, senior vice president of Oceana, told Insider that making bottles recyclable doesn't mean they won't end up in the ocean. Only about 30% of bottles are actually recycled, while the rest end up in landfills or in the environment. ""Coca-Cola needs systems to ensure they actually get that bottle back,"" Littlejohn said. Expanding a refillable model would go a long way, Littlejohn said, which isn't big in the US but is popular in some European countries and Mexico. Investing in curbside recycling and new infrastructure would help, too. Coca-Cola is aiming for 25% of beverages by volume sold in returnable bottles by 2030 and told Insider that it spent $17 million in the US to support recycling infrastructure and consumer education campaigns. ""I'm shocked at how little that is,"" Littlejohn said. ""Coca-Cola sells billions of dollars worth of soft drinks a year, and their biggest market is the US.""

Kroger,KR,2019/6/14,"animal mistreatment, fraud, supply chain issues, products (health and environmental issues), supply chain issues","REFILE-FOCUS-Sparkly unicorn ice cream: Krogerâ€™s bid win grocery wars
(Refiles to correct typographical error in paragraph 5) By Emma Thomasson and Richa Naidu BERLIN/CHICAGO, June 20 (Reuters) - Kroger Co has room to improve on sales and is looking to its Deluxe Unicorn Swirl ice cream and other store-brand products to boost growth, Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on Thursday.
But Kroger Co believes trendy house-brand items like Unicorn Swirl will help it win market share from Walmart Inc, Aldi and Amazon.com Inc .
By churning out new house-brand items, Kroger hopes to tap into broad sales growth for private labels.
Kroger added 1,022 ""own brand"" items in 2018, and each supermarket on average stocks more than 15,000 private-label products such as pet food, clothes, furniture, meal kits and office supplies.
Kroger's 16 house brands account for more than 30% of unit sales, the company said in March.

Meanwhile, Kroger's private-label margin is typically 600 to 800 basis points higher than that of big consumer brands, McMullen said on Thursday.","(Refiles to correct typographical error in paragraph 5) By Emma Thomasson and Richa Naidu BERLIN/CHICAGO, June 20 (Reuters) - Kroger Co has room to improve on sales and is looking to its Deluxe Unicorn Swirl ice cream and other store-brand products to boost growth, Chief Executive Rodney McMullen said on Thursday. Multicolored, sparkly ice cream is an unlikely battleground in U.S. grocery stores. But Kroger Co believes trendy house-brand items like Unicorn Swirl will help it win market share from Walmart Inc, Aldi and Amazon.com Inc . ""We know we can do better when it comes to identical sales results,"" McMullen told analysts after Kroger posted quarterly same-store sales below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down 2.5%. The grocer's store-brand business was one of its most powerful tools, McMullen said. Kroger's own brand sales for the quarter rose 3.3%. Unicorn ice cream, pork belly bites and artisan jerky were among 219 new store brand items that boosted sales by $225 million. By churning out new house-brand items, Kroger hopes to tap into broad sales growth for private labels. The push comes as grocers compete fiercely on price and race to expand online ordering and delivery, an area where the biggest U.S. grocery chain has lagged. Kroger added 1,022 ""own brand"" items in 2018, and each supermarket on average stocks more than 15,000 private-label products such as pet food, clothes, furniture, meal kits and office supplies. Kroger's 16 house brands account for more than 30% of unit sales, the company said in March. ""We don't see this slowing down at all,"" McMullen had told Reuters in a separate interview in May. Cincinnati-based Kroger has long made store brands that compete with name brands from Kraft Heinz Co, Nestle and others. But it started focusing more on its own brands in 2012 and flagged them as key to reviving sales growth when introducing its â€œRestock Krogerâ€?plan two years ago. Graphic on store brand growth: https://tmsnrt.rs/31Ff7UN Kroger's Simple Truth line hit $2.3 billion in annual sales to become the biggest U.S. natural and organic brand, the grocer said in March. Sales of its Kroger range and premium Private Selection food line are also growing, with the total own brand portfolio expanding 45% since 2011. Starbucks Corp kicked off the unicorn food craze in 2017, sparking a social media frenzy with its pink and blue Unicorn Frappuccino. Breakfast cereal and cake followed, and Target Corp launched a cherry-flavored Unicorn Magic ice cream last year. Kroger debuted its cake batter-flavored Unicorn Swirl in March, and saw more than 2.5 million likes and shares on social media for the product on National Unicorn Day on April 9. ""Kroger has been very clever about expanding into rapidly growing categories,"" said Neil Saunders, who heads retail consultancy GlobalData, highlighting brands like Simple Truth and Home Chef meal kits. Simple Truth has likewise benefited from a social media boost. Kayla Schneider, 28, a vegan receptionist and beauty advisor from Fenton, Michigan, has 11,000 Twitter followers and earlier this year tweeted when Simple Truth vegan ice cream went on sale. â€œI have a lot of followers who also share my type of diet and I like sharing new finds/yummy products so they can try them out as well,â€?Schneider said in a Twitter direct message. Almost half of Kroger's private-label grocery lines, including bakery and dairy items, are produced in its 37 plants, giving it an advantage when it comes to creating and testing out items. Kroger makes more in-house than other U.S. retailers, with Walmart outsourcing all store-brand production until very recently, when it opened a dairy in Indiana, retail consultant Roger Davidson said. ""They (Kroger) are very serious about private label and in my opinion better than any consumer goods company in the U.S.,"" said Davidson, who used to oversee food procurement at Walmart. ""Big CPG companies are really struggling,"" he said, referring to consumer packaged goods makers. Kroger has been looking for ways to claw back market share from Walmart, the world's biggest retailer, and German discount chain Aldi. It also has to grapple with Amazon's fast-growing private-label sales, both online and in Whole Foods. MARGIN PRESSURES Soaring commodities and freight costs have pressured margins at companies like Procter & Gamble Co and Unilever PLC in recent years, making it harder for them to compete. Meanwhile, Kroger's private-label margin is typically 600 to 800 basis points higher than that of big consumer brands, McMullen said on Thursday. Private-label products on average are about 20% less expensive than branded goods, according to data from market research firm IRI. At a Kroger-owned Mariano's in Chicago, 24 bottles of own-brand water cost $2.50 versus $4.99 for Nestle's Pure Life, for instance. The worldâ€™s No.1 consumer company said in April there was no point in Pure Life trying to outcompete private-label bottled water. Own-brand products made up 14.9% of U.S. store sales in 2018, up half a percentage point, with frozen, pet and baby products growing fastest and millennials buying most, according to IRI. That compares with an international average of 39.4%. The share is highest in Britain at 52.5%, in part due to discounters like Aldi. Aldi is expanding rapidly in the United States and seeks to become the No.3 U.S. grocery chain with 2,500 stores by 2022. It sells products that are almost entirely house brand. KETO, PALEO, FLEXITARIAN Kroger has a 400-person team developing its brands. The company poached Gil Phipps in 2012 from Texas-based retailer H-E-B, which has sought to emulate British store brand leaders like Sainsbury's since the 1990s. But Walmart has also been adding private labels, while already squeezing Kroger on price and outperforming on e-commerce and automation. In March, Walmart launched its Hello Bello line of plant-based baby products with actor couple Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard. A month later, it introduced Unicorn Sparkle ice cream selling for $2.24 for 48 ounces, compared to $2.50 for Kroger's Unicorn Swirl. As part of the ""Restock Kroger"" drive, the company is also investing in store revamps and delivery, although a joint venture with British online grocer Ocado is taking time to ramp up. ""I worry whether Kroger is really keeping the end consumer in mind. They have so many irons in the fire,"" said consultant Davidson.

President Donald Trump has made high prescription drug prices a top issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and said that drug companies were ""getting away with murder"".

The list price for one vial will be $144.68. Novo will also introduce a so-called $99 cash card programme from Jan 2020, which patients can use to buy three vials or two packs of pens of Novo's analog insulins for a flat cost of $99, which for most diabetics is an adequate supply for one month. The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication. ""While we will continue to do what we can to help address affordability challenges in the short-term, changes within the system are required to make sustainable and meaningful affordability a reality,"" said Novo in a statement. In April, France's Sanofi said it would cut the cost of its insulin products to $99 per month for uninsured patients and others who pay cash in the United States. Eli Lilly started selling a half-price version of its Humalog insulin in May. The list price for Lilly's authorized generic insulin -- sold under the name Insulin Lispro -- is $137.35 per vial.

Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. makes a similar antibody-based Covid-19 treatment that previouslyreceived FDA authorization. Companies are developing Covid-19 antibody treatments that are more convenient to take and can tackle emerging virus mutations. Lilly co-developed bamlanivimab with Canadian company AbCellera Biologics Inc. It was derived from a blood sample taken from one of the first U.S. patients to recover from Covid-19. Lilly licensed the second antibody, etesevimab, from Junshi Biosciences of China. A 1,035-person study found that the two-drug cocktail reduced the combined risk of death and hospitalization by 70% compared with patients who received a placebo.

Eli Lilly and Company,LLY,2022/11/1,animal mistreatment,"fake tweet sparked panic Eli Lilly cost Twitter millions
The nine-word tweet was sent Thursday afternoon from an account using the name and logo of the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., and it immediately attracted a giant response: ""We are excited to announce insulin is free now."" The tweet carried a blue ""verified"" check mark, a badge that Twitter had used for years to signal an account's authenticity â€?and that Twitter's new billionaire owner, Elon Musk, had, while declaring ""power to the people!"" suddenly opened to anyone, regardless of their identity, as long as they paid $8.
By the time Twitter had removed the tweet, more than six hours later, the account had inspired other fake Eli Lilly copycats and been viewed millions of times.
By Friday morning, Eli Lilly executives had ordered a halt to all Twitter ad campaigns â€?a potentially serious blow, given that the $330 billion company controls the kind of massive advertising budget that Musk says the company needs to avoid bankruptcy.
In a short statement Friday, Eli Lilly said it was ""working to correct this situation."" Musk has said the sweeping change to Twitter's ""verified"" system, first unveiled in 2009, would shake up the establishment journalists he routinely criticizes by breaking their ""oligopoly on information."" Twitter is not checking the identity of anyone who pays $8 for the check mark, which looks identical to the current ""verified"" badge.
â€?I just don't see a world in which advertisers are going to be excited to come back and willing to commit dollars to his experiment."" As fake accounts multiplied on the site Thursday, Musk responded to a sexually explicit tweet from a fake President Biden with two cry-laughing emoji and tweeted that Twitter users had shared ""some epically funny tweets."" By Friday morning, however, Twitter had paused its blue-check program, known as Twitter Blue, due to ""impersonation issues"" and began attaching ""official"" labels to Eli Lilly and other major corporate accounts.
On Friday evening, Musk tweeted Twitter would begin adding a ""parody"" tag to fake blue-check accounts.
Omnicom Media Group, an ad firm that represents corporate giants such as Apple and McDonald's, recommended clients pause all Twitter activity, saying in a memo first reported by The Verge that the ""risk to our clients' brand safety has risen sharply to a level most would find unacceptable."" For Eli Lilly, the $8 fake account represented a disastrous and high-profile surprise.
When Eli Lilly's share price sank 4 percent on Friday â€?in line with a drop in other health care stocks â€?many Twitter users credited the fake account: The ""tweet just cost Eli Lilly billions,"" said one tweet with more than 380,000 likes.
Twitter's change, O'Connor said, has shaken not just Eli Lilly but many other companies now worried about the risk of participating in a platform where an account's legitimacy is no longer guaranteed.","The nine-word tweet was sent Thursday afternoon from an account using the name and logo of the pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Co., and it immediately attracted a giant response: ""We are excited to announce insulin is free now."" The tweet carried a blue ""verified"" check mark, a badge that Twitter had used for years to signal an account's authenticity â€?and that Twitter's new billionaire owner, Elon Musk, had, while declaring ""power to the people!"" suddenly opened to anyone, regardless of their identity, as long as they paid $8. But the tweet was a fake â€?one of what became a fast-multiplying horde of impersonated businesses, political leaders, government agencies and celebrities. By the time Twitter had removed the tweet, more than six hours later, the account had inspired other fake Eli Lilly copycats and been viewed millions of times. Inside the real Eli Lilly, the fake sparked a panic, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly. Company officials scrambled to contact Twitter representatives and demanded they kill the viral spoof, worried it could undermine their brand's reputation or push false claims about people's medicine. Twitter, its staffing cut in half, didn't react for hours. The aftermath of that $8 spoof offers a potentially costly lesson for Musk, who has long treated Twitter as a playground for bawdy jokes and trolls but now must find a way to operate as a business following his $44 billion takeover. By Friday morning, Eli Lilly executives had ordered a halt to all Twitter ad campaigns â€?a potentially serious blow, given that the $330 billion company controls the kind of massive advertising budget that Musk says the company needs to avoid bankruptcy. They also paused their Twitter publishing plan for all corporate accounts around the world. ""For $8, they're potentially losing out on millions of dollars in ad revenue,"" said Amy O'Connor, a former senior communications official at Eli Lilly who now works at a trade association. ""What's the benefit to a company â€?of staying on Twitter? It's not worth the risk when patient trust and health are on the line."" Eli Lilly, which declined to respond to questions about the episode or how much money it has spent on advertising with Twitter, is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical manufacturers, known for the anti-depression drug Prozac and the diabetes treatments Trulicity and Humalog. It maintains a robust Twitter presence. In addition to its main corporate account, @LillyPad, it runs stand-alone accounts devoted to diabetes care, European health policy, clinical trials, rheumatology and the distribution of health information in Spanish, Italian and French. It spends more than $100 million a year on TV commercials and digital-ad campaigns in the United States, according to MediaRadar, a marketing data firm. When Twitter failed to react quickly to its entreaties about the fake account, Eli Lilly took to its official account in the late afternoon Thursday to apologize to its 130,000 followers for the ""misleading"" fake. When the fake account still was active five hours later, a Twitter ad-sales rep in New York publicly pleaded with Musk for the fake account to be removed. Musk did not respond, but the account was suspended late Thursday night. The next morning, Musk tweeted that the launch of Twitter's new $8 verification regime was ""overall proceeding well."" Musk did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Twitter's communications team also did not respond; many of its employees were fired in the massive layoff that Musk imposed on Nov. 4. In a short statement Friday, Eli Lilly said it was ""working to correct this situation."" Musk has said the sweeping change to Twitter's ""verified"" system, first unveiled in 2009, would shake up the establishment journalists he routinely criticizes by breaking their ""oligopoly on information."" Twitter is not checking the identity of anyone who pays $8 for the check mark, which looks identical to the current ""verified"" badge. Musk has said spammers and impersonators would be dissuaded by the fact that their $8 would not be paid back if their accounts were suspended. The sudden shift, however, has decimated some of the last lingering bits of trust among advertisers in the platform, said Jenna Golden, who ran Twitter's political and advocacy ad-sales team until 2017 and now runs Golden Strategies, a D.C. consulting firm. Twitter, she said, has never been a ""must buy"" for advertisers. Though a popular way to reach influential political figures and news junkies, it has never had the scale and performance of digital juggernauts like Google and Facebook. Now, with its verification system in shreds, ""it's making it really easy for advertisers to say: 'You know what, I don't need to be here anymore,' and walk away,"" Golden said. ""People are not just providing inaccurate information but damaging information, with the ability to look legitimate. That is just not a stable place for a brand to invest."" Compounding the issue, Golden said, is Musk himself, who has pushed tumultuous changes to the company that have stunned paying customers, confused industry observers and led Twitter's power users to head for the exits. ""People see the leader of this company who is erratic and unpredictable, who is making very knee-jerk decisions and rolling them back quite quickly,"" she said. ""He claims he wants to create a successful business, then does everything he can to turn off the advertisers that are its main revenue stream. â€?I just don't see a world in which advertisers are going to be excited to come back and willing to commit dollars to his experiment."" As fake accounts multiplied on the site Thursday, Musk responded to a sexually explicit tweet from a fake President Biden with two cry-laughing emoji and tweeted that Twitter users had shared ""some epically funny tweets."" By Friday morning, however, Twitter had paused its blue-check program, known as Twitter Blue, due to ""impersonation issues"" and began attaching ""official"" labels to Eli Lilly and other major corporate accounts. On Friday evening, Musk tweeted Twitter would begin adding a ""parody"" tag to fake blue-check accounts. He also defended Eli Lilly, tweeting at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) â€?who had used the fake to call attention to high prices for insulin, a lifesaving drug â€?that the ""price question is complex."" Few of the nation's most prominent businesses and political figures have escaped viral Twitter impersonations in recent days: Former presidents (Donald Trump, George W. Bush) and giant companies (the defense contractor Lockheed Martin, Musk's automaker Tesla) have all been retweeted widely, with fake-but-verified badges attached. That shift has led some major advertisers to also pull back. Omnicom Media Group, an ad firm that represents corporate giants such as Apple and McDonald's, recommended clients pause all Twitter activity, saying in a memo first reported by The Verge that the ""risk to our clients' brand safety has risen sharply to a level most would find unacceptable."" For Eli Lilly, the $8 fake account represented a disastrous and high-profile surprise. The Indianapolis-based conglomerate employs more than 37,000 people across 18 countries and brings in $28 billion a year in revenue. Sanders and many others used the parody to shine a spotlight on insulin costs, a common point of company criticism. When Eli Lilly's share price sank 4 percent on Friday â€?in line with a drop in other health care stocks â€?many Twitter users credited the fake account: The ""tweet just cost Eli Lilly billions,"" said one tweet with more than 380,000 likes. ""The most consequential $8 in modern human history,"" said another. Some Twitter users celebrated the accounts as modern satires or expressed excitement at the idea that Musk's move could backfire, exposing Twitter to legal threats. Other fake-but-verified Eli Lilly spoofs have proliferated, gaining their own broad audiences before they, too, were suspended: One tweeted, ""Humalog is now $400. We can do this whenever we want and there's nothing you can do about it."" To health care companies such as Eli Lilly, the change offered not just a reputational threat but the risk that other fakes could threaten people's well-being. Eli Lilly's Twitter accounts routinely field medical questions and work to correct misinformation about side effects, health issues and long-term care. Twitter's change, O'Connor said, has shaken not just Eli Lilly but many other companies now worried about the risk of participating in a platform where an account's legitimacy is no longer guaranteed. ""This isn't just about Twitter, this is about patients' health,"" O'Connor said. What if a public health group was ""spoofed and shared information that made people's diabetes worse? Where does it stop? It feels like this is literally just the beginning, and it's only going to get worse.""","<Incident Category>: animal mistreatment

* The Music Royalty Boom While the ticketing issues are no doubt frustrating for fans, they also highlight the significant demand for live entertainment and the continued opportunity in shares of Live Nation Entertainment (ticker: LYV), which remains a unique play on the growth of the live events business.
On Friday, Live Nation shares skidded as much as 9% after the New York Times reported that the Justice Department is investigating the company and its Ticketmaster subsidiary over their domination of the live music industry.
To get clearance, Live Nation signed a consent decree with the Justice Department that barred the company from retaliating against venues that used other ticketing platforms, and required the company to license their ticketing platform to the entertainment company AEG, or Anschutz Entertainment Group.
Nonetheless, this week's snafus with Taylor Swift ticketing has spurred new demands from fans and lawmakers for regulators to consider hitting the undo button on the 12-year-old deal.
Rep. Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who has complained about the ticketing business for years, has been pushing for new rules allowing federal agencies to undo ""bad mergers,"" pointing to the Live Nation-Ticketmaster transaction as ""a poster child of consolidation gone bad."" Pascrell has made several attempts to introduce the BOSS Act, which would impose new rules on the ticketing industry.

It's been a tough week for Taylor Swift fans who were hoping to buy tickets for the pop stars' upcoming tour. Heavy demand caused ongoing issues with Ticketmaster's website, disappointing potential concertgoers. On Thursday, Ticketmaster said it was cancelingFriday's public ticket sale, citing ""extraordinarily high demands on ticket systems and insufficient remaining ticket inventory."" There was similar frustration among Bruce Springsteen fans over the summer when they tried to buy tickets to his first tour since 2017.

Your Favorite Songs From Shakira and Springsteen. * The Music Royalty Boom While the ticketing issues are no doubt frustrating for fans, they also highlight the significant demand for live entertainment and the continued opportunity in shares of Live Nation Entertainment (ticker: LYV), which remains a unique play on the growth of the live events business. On Friday, Live Nation shares skidded as much as 9% after the New York Times reported that the Justice Department is investigating the company and its Ticketmaster subsidiary over their domination of the live music industry. The story, attributed to ""two people with knowledge of the matter,"" says the probe pre-dates this week's troubles with ticketing for a new tour by Taylor Swift. Live Nation acquired Ticketmaster in 2010 in an all-stock merger that created a company then valued at about $2.5 billion. The deal combined the largest concert promotion company with the dominant player in ticketing. The merger attracted regulatory scrutiny right from the start. To get clearance, Live Nation signed a consent decree with the Justice Department that barred the company from retaliating against venues that used other ticketing platforms, and required the company to license their ticketing platform to the entertainment company AEG, or Anschutz Entertainment Group. In 2019, the company signed an amended agreement with the Justice Department, adding tighter restrictions and potential fines. That agreement runs through 2025. Nonetheless, this week's snafus with Taylor Swift ticketing has spurred new demands from fans and lawmakers for regulators to consider hitting the undo button on the 12-year-old deal. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tweeted this week that the merger ""should never have been approved,"" adding ""break them up."" Sens. Richard Blumenbthal and Amy Klobuchar wrote a letter to the Justice Department antitrust division asserting that ""online ticket markets are not working for American consumers,"" and asking for an investigation of the state of competition in ticketing and whether Live Nation has complied with its consent decree. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti this week said he had launched an investigation into Ticketmaster in the wake of complaints from people trying to buy tickets to Swift's events. Rep. Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who has complained about the ticketing business for years, has been pushing for new rules allowing federal agencies to undo ""bad mergers,"" pointing to the Live Nation-Ticketmaster transaction as ""a poster child of consolidation gone bad."" Pascrell has made several attempts to introduce the BOSS Act, which would impose new rules on the ticketing industry. (An allusion to Springsteen's nicknameâ€”The Boss â€?the bill is formally called ""The Better Oversight of Secondary Sales and Accountability in Concert Ticketing Act."") Asked to comment, Live Nation pointed to a statement on its website about the issues around the Taylor Swift ticket sale. ""The biggest venues and artists turn to us because we have the leading ticketing technology in the worldâ€”that doesn't mean it's perfect, and clearly for Taylor's on sale it wasn't,"" the company said. ""But we're always working to improve the ticket buying experience. Especially for high demand on sales, which continue to test new limits."" Swift addressed the ticketing problems in a post on Friday to her Instagram account. ""I'm not going to make excuses for anyone because we asked them, multiple times, if they could handle this kind of demand and we were assured they could,"" she wrote. ""It's truly amazing that 2.4 million people got tickets, but it really pisses me off that a lot of them feel like they went through several bear attacks to get them."" It's worth noting here that despite this week's calls for breaking up the Live Nation/Ticketmaster deal, the Taylor Swift tour is managed not by Live Nation but rather by AEG, which has its own ticketing platform, called AXS. In a statement Friday, AEG said that using AXS wasn't really an option. ""Ticketmaster's exclusive deals with the vast majority of venues on the Eras tour required us to ticket through their system,"" AEG said. ""We didn't have a choice."" Live Nation's financial results have benefited from a recovery in the music concert business, as consumers who were housebound during the pandemic flooded into live events. In the September quarter, for instance, Live Nation revenue was up 63% from a year ago, to $6.2 billion. The company said it had the highest quarterly attendance ever, 44 million people at more than 11,000 events. And the company said that tickets sold for 2023 are up double-digits from the equivalent period a year earlier. Nonetheless, Live Nation shares are down about 39% for the year. Shares closed down 2.9% on Thursday. Brandon Ross, an analyst with research firm Lightshed Partners, says the company hasn't been immune to the broad selloff in technology and media shares. He also says that some investors think this year's spike in revenue and event attendance won't be sustainableâ€”that consumers will moderate ticketing buying in 2023. But Ross notes that ""early signals fly in the face of that argument."" And he says this week's fury triggered by the issue with Taylor Swift ticketing proves the case. ""This hoopla would not exist if there were not demand for events for next year,"" he says. Ross also notes a technical reason for pressure on the stock this week. Liberty Media, a holding company controlled by billionaire investor John Malone, owns a 31% stake in Live Nation. This week, Liberty announced plans for a new tracking stock called Liberty Live Group, which will include the Live Nation stake and a few other odds and ends. Ross says the tracker creates an arbitrage opportunity that will likely involve investors buying the tracker and shorting Live Nation to capture the difference in value between the two assets. Though the tracker won't launch until next year, he thinks some people are building short positions in Live Nation now in preparation. Meanwhile, Ross says that Ticketmaster was the only ticketing firm that had the infrastructure to handle the huge demand for Taylor Swift ticketsâ€?more than 14 million tried to buy tickets, with two million ultimately sold in one day. Live Nation said that it had enough demand to fill 900 stadium shows, or almost 20 times the number Swift is actually performing. AEG's own ticketing platform couldn't have handled the demand, Ross says. Ross thinks investors should buy Live Nation shares here. ""Investors will be surprised by the 2023 performance,"" he says. ""The leading indicators are highly suggestive of a record year."" He also notes that Live Nation has been consolidating its ticketing around the world onto a centralized platform, an approach that he thinks will reduce costs and drive profitability. And he sees growing opportunities for the company's sponsorship business, as advertisers look for alternatives to linear TV and digital advertising. The bottom line: Ross thinks the stock is worth more than $100 a share, nearly 40% above its recent level. Write to Eric J.

Two pending antitrust lawsuits paint a compelling story of an agreement among these industry giants to stifle competition, raise prices, and prevent comparison shopping by consumers.
But others would have featured competing hotels â€?think Hilton, Hyatt, or Wyndham â€?as well as online travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline.

Hotel cabal wants to limit your choices How might consumers be harmed by a collusive agreement among the Big 6?
According to a 2014 Google study, keyword searching was the most common starting point for consumers seeking to book hotel rooms online.
Even more importantly, Google found that consumers who searched for a specific hotel brand would often end up purchasing a room from another brand.
This type of searching and switching is essential for robust online competition â€?whether massive hotel groups like it or not.
The lawsuits come on the heels of the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s decision in a case against 1-800 Contacts, which found that a similar agreement among another group of rivals unlawfully harmed competition and consumers.
Antitrust laws protect the public at large Left to their own devices, companies in a variety of markets will choose to collude rather than compete.","Amid the never-ending parade of negative publicity surrounding big tech companies, it can be difficult these days to remember that not everything involving the Internet is terrible. But bright spots do remain. A task as simple as booking a hotel, for example, was incredibly difficult and time-consuming in the pre-digital world. Silicon Valley may have its faults, but consumers clearly benefit from the ability to compare travel options online. Unfortunately, what is good for consumers is not always welcome among established incumbents. Together, the hotel industryâ€™s â€œBig 6â€?â€?Hilton, Marriott, Choice, IHG, Wyndham, and Hyatt â€?have gobbled up a majority of U. S. hotel rooms. Two pending antitrust lawsuits paint a compelling story of an agreement among these industry giants to stifle competition, raise prices, and prevent comparison shopping by consumers. Late last month, a federal court in Illinois bolstered these claims by allowing one of the lawsuits to move forward, and this week, oral arguments are set in a second suit, brought by online travel agency TravelPass Group. Both portray a hidden conspiracy that may have had a harmful â€?and ongoing â€?impact on travelers. Read more commentary: Google, Facebook, Amazon: Warren's toothless break-up plan ignores real Big Tech threats Donald Trump must bust Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google monopolies like Teddy Roosevelt. Newspapers want anti-trust pass to handle Facebook, Google To illustrate, try a simple experiment: Type â€œMarriott Dallasâ€?into your Google search bar. Several years ago, that keyword search would likely have yielded a wide variety of paid advertisements at the top of the page. One of them may have linked directly to Marriottâ€™s website. But others would have featured competing hotels â€?think Hilton, Hyatt, or Wyndham â€?as well as online travel agencies like Expedia and Priceline. Today, your search results probably look quite different. Most consumers will see only one type of advertisement at the top of the results: a link directly to Marriottâ€™s own websites. Competitor ads seem to have vanished altogether, and online travel agency ads are increasingly hard to find. The change was abrupt. Google search data suggests that, in late 2014, the Big 6 suddenly stopped bidding on one anotherâ€™s branded keywords, according to one of the lawsuits. Under the antitrust laws, collusion among competitors is regarded as â€œthe supreme evil. â€?The adverse effects on consumers are typically immediate and substantial. Hotel cabal wants to limit your choices How might consumers be harmed by a collusive agreement among the Big 6? According to a 2014 Google study, keyword searching was the most common starting point for consumers seeking to book hotel rooms online. Even more importantly, Google found that consumers who searched for a specific hotel brand would often end up purchasing a room from another brand. Search results are an important driver of consumer behavior. This type of searching and switching is essential for robust online competition â€?whether massive hotel groups like it or not. And it occurs every day among consumers seeking out countless other products. We may initially look for Coca-Cola at the supermarket, or Nike trainers at a shoe store, but then end up trying a new or different brand after comparing products and prices. What healthy free-market system would allow Coke or Nike to collude with competitors to fence off their respective brands so that shoppers could see only the one brand they were initially seeking? Yet the pending lawsuits against the Big 6 depict just such a restriction. Disturbingly, this may be part of a broader trend. The lawsuits come on the heels of the Federal Trade Commissionâ€™s decision in a case against 1-800 Contacts, which found that a similar agreement among another group of rivals unlawfully harmed competition and consumers. Antitrust laws protect the public at large Left to their own devices, companies in a variety of markets will choose to collude rather than compete. By stifling competition, collusive agreements can allow participants to raise prices, impose added fees, avoid competing on quality, and disadvantage innovative new challengers. In the context of online search, the danger is clear: as the FTCâ€™s 1-800 Contacts opinion observes, search is the â€œvery meansâ€?by which competition takes place in the modern digital economy. A few years ago, online lending clearinghouse LendingTree made a splash with its slogan, â€œWhen banks compete, you win. â€?Unfortunately, the inverse is equally true: when companies stop competing, we lose. Antitrust laws can be an effective remedy, but only when they are actively enforced. The private plaintiffs challenging the Big 6 hotel groups have already shed important light on an often opaque market. But antitrust laws are also about protecting the public at large, and if collusive agreements are not halted in one market, they may well spread to others. State attorneys general and the U. S. Department of Justice, along with the Federal Trade Commission, have all signaled their desire to promote online competition. This may be a good moment to join the fight. John M. Newman is a law professor at the University of Memphis School of Law specializing in antitrust, a former trial attorney with the U. S. Department of Justice, and author of the forthcoming article â€œAntitrust in Digital Markets. â€?

Below: Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan is under pressure to investigate reports that U.S. user data on TikTok was repeatedly accessed in China, and Marriott acknowledges one of its computers was breached.
Here are some key questions.A potentially massive leak of data from police in China's most populous city is heightening concerns that sensitive information on a billion Chinese citizens â€?yes, a billion â€?could be exposed.
The Wall Street Journal and New York Times separately called people whose data was included in the leak.
Here's more from Wall Street Journal reporter Karen Hao: But Chinese authorities haven't publicly commented on or confirmed the alleged leak.
The leak comes as Chinese regulators scrutinize the data security practices of Chinese tech firms that they say have collected troves of information about Chinese users.
It also comes amid criticism that Chinese authorities are surveilling and amassing massive amounts of data on Chinese citizens as part of a drive to track them and predict crimes, the New York Times reported last month.
Some of the data said whether people included in the data set had been labeled a ""key person"" by China's Ministry of Public Security, the New York Times reported.
They've blocked popular hashtags like ""data leak,"" ""Shanghai national security database breach"" and ""1 billion citizens' records leak"" on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media network, the Financial Times's Ryan McMorrow and Gloria Li report.

Make sure you tune in tomorrow, when our esteemed colleague Joe Menn will helm the newsletter â€?you won't want to miss it. Below: Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan is under pressure to investigate reports that U.S. user data on TikTok was repeatedly accessed in China, and Marriott acknowledges one of its computers was breached. We're still learning the details of the China police leak. Here are some key questions.A potentially massive leak of data from police in China's most populous city is heightening concerns that sensitive information on a billion Chinese citizens â€?yes, a billion â€?could be exposed. The data includes personal information like phone numbers and birthdays. But, perhaps most troublingly, it includes reports about crimes like domestic violence and has data from 1995 to 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported. Billions of records could catapult the leak as one of the largest ever. But much is still not known about the incident, which is raising more questions than answers. Here are four of the biggest questions about the leak: 1. Is the data real?The leak has sketchy origins, with a pseudonymous user first advertising the data on a hacker forum Thursday. They have released what they called a ""sample"" amounting to several hundred thousand records from the database. So far, it appears that at least some of that data checks out. The Wall Street Journal and New York Times separately called people whose data was included in the leak. Nine people who the two outlets called confirmed that details about them in the leak were accurate. Here's more from Wall Street Journal reporter Karen Hao: But Chinese authorities haven't publicly commented on or confirmed the alleged leak. Shanghai police and China's internet regulator didn't respond to the Wall Street Journal's request for comment. Such ""radio silence"" is unusual in the wake of data breaches, but perhaps less unusual for Chinese police who don't communicate in the same way as Western companies, Troy Hunt, the founder of Have I Been Pwned, a website that lets people check if their data was exposed in data breaches, told me. The leak comes as Chinese regulators scrutinize the data security practices of Chinese tech firms that they say have collected troves of information about Chinese users. It also comes amid criticism that Chinese authorities are surveilling and amassing massive amounts of data on Chinese citizens as part of a drive to track them and predict crimes, the New York Times reported last month. 2. Who has the data?The data is being offered for sale for 10 bitcoin (around $200,000). It's not clear how many people have approached the seller, ""ChinaDan,"" to buy the massive trove of data. It's also not clear how widely circulated the data was before Thursday, and it's not clear how many people already had access to the data. The database was accessible online for months before it hit the public spotlight, security researchers told CNN's Yong Xiong, Hannah Ritchie and Nectar Gan. That could make the leak even more devastating. If it was indeed ""exposed for a long period of time, you'd have to assume other people found it,"" Hunt told me. 3. Who was behind the leak?The origins, provenance and sequence of events leading up to the Thursday post are fuzzy. ""ChinaDan"" hasn't publicly commented on when they got the data, if they plan to keep trying to sell it and if they have sold it to anyone. They didn't respond to a request for comment on these issues. It's also not clear if they are acting alone, are part of a wider operation or are sponsored by a government or other backer. 4. What is the impact?The leak would amount to a massive blunder if it is legitimate and did in fact lie unsecured for more than a year. It could also lead to real-world harm if particularly sensitive information, like reports of sexual assault and abuse, were to get out. Some of the data said whether people included in the data set had been labeled a ""key person"" by China's Ministry of Public Security, the New York Times reported. That blacklist has included people with mental illness, people who use drugs and political troublemakers, the outlet previously reported. China doesn't notify people when they've been added to the list. Although they haven't acknowledged the leak, Chinese authorities have seemingly taken notice of it. They've blocked popular hashtags like ""data leak,"" ""Shanghai national security database breach"" and ""1 billion citizens' records leak"" on Weibo, a Twitter-like social media network, the Financial Times's Ryan McMorrow and Gloria Li report. One user said they were even invited to discuss a viral post about the leak with local authorities, McMorrow and Li report. The keys Senate Intel chiefs urge FTC to probe data security 'deception' by TikTokYesterday the leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee called on Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan to investigate reports that U.S. user data on TikTok was repeatedly accessed in China, a revelation that reignited security concerns over the popular video-sharing app, my colleague Cristiano Lima of The Technology 202 notes. U.S. lawmakers have long expressed concern at the prospect of Chinese government officials gaining or seizing information on U.S. users through the app, owned by Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance. Chair Mark R. Warner (D-Va.) and Vice Chair Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) urged the agency to probe the company ""on the basis of apparent deception by TikTok"" regarding its practices. The senators wrote that recent reports ""suggest that TikTok has also misrepresented its corporate governance practices, including to Congressional committees such as ours."" The FTC declined to comment. ""For two years, we've talked openly about our work to limit access to user data across regions, and in our letter to senators last week we were clear about our progress in limiting access even further through our work with Oracle,"" said TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter. ""As we've said repeatedly, TikTok has never shared U.S. user data with the Chinese government, nor would we if asked."" Last week, a group of Republican senators decried the recent disclosures and demanded answers from the company in a separate letter. In response, TikTok confirmed to the lawmakers that employees in China can access U.S. user data after clearing security protocols, Bloomberg News reported. In a rare interview Sunday on CNN, TikTok's head of public policy for the Americas Michael Beckerman said the company has ""never shared information with the Chinese government, nor would we."" U.S. government unveils algorithms designed to withstand quantum computersThe National Institute of Standards and Technology announced the first four encryption algorithms that it chose as part of a competition. It comes amid a race to find encryption algorithms that will be able to withstand a generation of quantum computers expected in 15 to 20 years, this newsletter reported in April. Quantum computers will have more firepower than current computers, making it easy for them to crack a current generation of encryption algorithms that keeps communication such as emails secret as they travel from place to place. The new algorithms ""rely on math problems that both conventional and quantum computers should have difficulty solving, thereby defending privacy both now and down the road,"" NIST said. It's not the end of the road, however. NIST still plans to announce four additional algorithms. It expects the algorithms to be included in a new standard for post-quantum encryption that it'll finalize in around two years, NIST says. Industry also has to adopt the standard, a process that could take years, this newsletter previously reported. Hackers briefly breached Marriott, hotel giant saysThe hackers say they're ""an international group working for about five years"" and stole around 20 gigabytes worth of credit card, employee and guest information from an employee at a hotel near Baltimore-Washington International Airport, CyberScoop's AJ Vicens reports. Marriott told another website, databreaches.net, that it would notify 300 to 400 people of the breach, as well as regulators. Marriott ""is aware of a threat actor who used social engineering to trick one associate at a single Marriott hotel into providing access to the associate's computer,"" a spokesperson told CyberScoop. Their access ""only occurred for a short amount of time on one day. Marriott identified and was investigating the incident before the threat actor contacted the company in an extortion attempt, which Marriott did not pay,"" they said. The breach comes as Marriott is embroiled in a class-action lawsuit over a breach the company disclosed in 2018. The breach included more than 130 million records, and U.S. officials blamed it on China.

Luxury designers like Louis Vuitton, Fendi, and Dior are also reaching new shoppers on the app. Pumpkin spice donut taste test: Krispy Kreme annihilates Dunkin' It might only be September, but Pumpkin Spice season is upon us. As such, Irene compared Krispy Kreme's pumpkin spice donut collection to Dunkin's to see which was superior. Spoiler alert: Krispy Kreme won out.

Ms. Faulkner got pregnant by May, but the experience hasn't come without its bumps: The whole family contracted Covid in November.
Everyone recovered well and the baby is doing fine, Mr. Faulkner says.
""You can imagine that someone might respond to a very threatening crisis by saying, 'I want to strengthen my family.' "" Unintended births may also go up during this time, Dr. Hayford notes.
""You're holding your breath the entire time,"" says Marty McDonald, who gave birth to her daughter, Elle Olivia, on Jan. 18.
The 35-year-old is hoping to become pregnant with a sperm donation from a friend of Ms. Wapnick who lives nearby.
""Everyone is waiting for life to go back to normal, and for us, if we're lucky, life will never go back to normal,"" Ms. Wernet says.
""We just decided that our lives couldn't just stop,"" says Ms. Powers, who found out she was pregnant in June.
This is insane,' "" Ms. Powers says.","Marty McDonald, here with her husband, Kevin McDonald, became pregnant last spring. She gave birth to her daughter on Jan. 18. PHOTO: Laura Buckman for The Wall Street Journal It's a strange moment to bring a baby into the world. The pandemic has changed much of what it once meant to be expecting: a partner holding your hand through an ultrasound appointment, crowded baby showers and unsolicited advice from hovering strangers in the supermarket, family flying in to meet a new grandchild in the hospital. The constant threat of the virus has made our health feel precarious, and pregnant women are at higher risk for severe disease if they become infected. Much of the country is either struggling financially or bracing for economic impact. A Brookings Institution report projected there will be about 300,000 fewer births in 2021, an 8% drop from 2019. And yet, about a year into the pandemic, many would-be parents say they've grown tired of waiting. Some paused fertility treatments in the spring only to realize Covid wasn't going to disappear in a matter of months. For others, Covid was the push: the sign they needed to slow down and focus on life at home. Or the pandemic brought the silver lining of flexibilityâ€”remote work, canceled business travelâ€”that made having a baby possible. ""Everything was kind of home-centered, with work and school,"" says Landon Faulkner, whose wife, Kyra Faulkner, is due in February. ""In some ways, it seemed even easier."" Mr. Faulkner, a dad of three in Vineyard, Utah, had a vasectomy reversed in April after he and his wife felt called to have another child. Ms. Faulkner got pregnant by May, but the experience hasn't come without its bumps: The whole family contracted Covid in November. Everyone recovered well and the baby is doing fine, Mr. Faulkner says. A November survey of nearly 4,000 users by Modern Fertility, a maker of at-home hormone tests, found that 70% weren't changing their family planning decisions as a result of the pandemic. Of the 30% who were, most decided to delay having kids, or rethought the proposition altogether. But a quarter of that 30% accelerated their plans. ""There's some kinds of existential crises that make people kind of re-evaluate priorities,"" says Sarah Hayford, a sociology professor at Ohio State University who studies family formation and reproductive health. ""You can imagine that someone might respond to a very threatening crisis by saying, 'I want to strengthen my family.' "" Unintended births may also go up during this time, Dr. Hayford notes. It's been harder for women to access birth control and abortions in some places, amid lockdowns and a slowdown in some medical appointments. No matter the circumstances of the pregnancy, expecting a baby during a pandemic can be nerve-racking and isolating. ""You're holding your breath the entire time,"" says Marty McDonald, who gave birth to her daughter, Elle Olivia, on Jan. 18. The CEO of Boss Women Media Group, an online community for women, she lives in Dallas, hours away from family in Tennessee. She's only seen them once in over a yearâ€”for a funeral. ""I didn't even hug my mom,"" she says. Still, she says some moments of the past year have injected extra hope into her experience of preparing to welcome a new life. ""We're bringing our daughter into the world when there's the first Black woman vice president of the United States,"" Ms. McDonald told her husband, Kevin McDonald. ""She's going to be able to see possibilities."" The journey to conceive during Covid for Valerie Wernet and her wife, Emilie Wapnick, kicked off with a road trip from their home on British Columbia's Cortes Island. They hopped three ferries and traveled 3,000 miles to Charlotte, Vt., wiping down hotel rooms with Lysol as they went and heating cans of soup they'd packed in the car. ""We will go home when we're pregnant or when we give up,"" Ms. Wernet told me in December from the tiny cabin she and Ms. Wapnick rented upon arriving in the States. The 35-year-old is hoping to become pregnant with a sperm donation from a friend of Ms. Wapnick who lives nearby. ""Everyone is waiting for life to go back to normal, and for us, if we're lucky, life will never go back to normal,"" Ms. Wernet says. When Jenn Allen's most recent embryo transfer failed last spring, the news felt especially devastating. The 43-year old's fertility clinic was temporarily shuttering due to lockdowns. Ms. Allen was hesitant to keep trying amid a pandemic anyway. ""There was a grieving of like, 'When am I going to be able to do this?' "" she says. By fall, the Oakland, Calif., resident says she realized she couldn't wait for a vaccine to fulfill her dreams. She's now embarking on her 13th attempt to get pregnant. As a single woman, she sometimes worries about handling the stress of trying to get pregnantâ€”and stay healthyâ€”by herself during a health crisis. ""There might not be someone right there to say, 'Hey, you're spinning. You're kind of falling down a rabbit hole right now,' "" she says of managing the anxiety. Chelsea Powers, a 31-year-old mother of one in Carrollton, Texas, decided to try for a second baby despite being furloughed in May from her job at a real estate company. ""We just decided that our lives couldn't just stop,"" says Ms. Powers, who found out she was pregnant in June. ""There's never really the right time to have a baby."" Navigating a career setback and financial blow while preparing for a newborn has been tough. Ms. Powers grappled with whether to reveal her pregnancy during job interviews. She refinanced her mortgage and began buying meat in bulk from Costco to save money. Then, in November, she was formally laid off. ""As things progressed and got worse, I definitely felt like, 'What were we thinking? Why did we do this? This is insane,' "" Ms. Powers says. But she also feels a sense of peace.

One of the fiercest food-world fights in recent years has featured fast-food chains vying for supremacy over who can most successfully serve up a fried breast of chicken between two pieces of bread. This week, the battle will heat up again as McDonaldâ€™s finally enters the fray with its own take on the crispy chicken sandwich. On Wednesday, McDonaldâ€™s is releasing three versions: original, spicy and deluxe, with lettuce and tomato. McDonaldâ€™s knows burgers. Its Big Mac is recognized all around the globe. But the Golden Arches is years behind its peers in developing a truly competitive chicken sandwich, much to the frustration of many of its franchise owners. â€œWeâ€™ve been clamoring for it,â€?said Blake Casper, who owns dozens of McDonaldâ€™s restaurants in Florida and is chairman of the National Owners Association, an independent group of franchisees. â€œWeâ€™ve definitely been needing this focus on a chicken sandwich. Weâ€™re thrilled that weâ€™re finally getting very serious about this category.â€?In recent years, American fast-food customers have embraced chicken and, in particular, so-called Southern-style chicken sandwiches. Consumers in the United States ordered 2.6 billion of the crispy, juicy sandwiches last year, according to the NPD Group, a research firm. Fried chicken sandwiches were the second-most ordered item on the DoorDash platform, just behind chicken fingers, last year. A bevy of fast-food restaurants â€?Wendyâ€™s, Burger King, Shake Shack â€?have jumped on the crispy chicken-sandwich bandwagon, releasing or making plans to release new chicken sandwiches. Even Taco Bell is riding the wave, debuting a combination chicken sandwich/taco next month in limited markets. For years, the leader of the category was Chick-fil-A, which created its original chicken sandwich â€?with two pickles and a toasted, buttered bun â€?in 1964. Privately held and based in Atlanta, Chick-fil-A posted sales of $11 billion in 2019, according to an annual ranking of restaurant chains by QSR Magazine. That was dwarfed by McDonaldâ€™s $40 billion in U.S. systemwide sales that year, but the 2,500 Chick-fil-A franchise locations around the country averaged more than $4.5 million in sales in 2019. Thatâ€™s well above the average sales of $2.9 million for the nearly 14,000 McDonaldâ€™s restaurants in the United States â€?and is even more impressive given the fact that Chick-fil-A stores are closed on Sundays. But the chicken-sandwich battle really started in the summer of 2019, when Popeyes introduced its own fried-chicken sandwich (brioche bun, with pickles). Within days, Popeyes locations around the country saw lines stretched out their doors, and the sandwich became a viral knockout. It became so popular that the chain sold out of months of supply within two weeks and had to pull the sandwich from its menu for more than two months to secure ingredients and negotiate with its suppliers. Thanks in large part to the popularity of its chicken sandwich, Popeyesâ€?comparable-store sales grew nearly 18 percent in 2020 from the year before, compared with an 11 percent decline at Burger King. Burger King, which, like Popeyes, is owned by Restaurant Brands International, is introducing its own take on the crispy chicken sandwich this year. McDonaldâ€™s journey into this category dates to 2008, when it introduced the Southern Style Chicken Sandwich. That was a fried chicken fillet served on a hamburger bun with pickles, an offering some said looked suspiciously like Chick-fil-Aâ€™s signature sandwich. The McDonaldâ€™s version was discontinued in 2015. About four years ago, executives at McDonaldâ€™s decided it was time to try again. Using the Southern Style Chicken sandwich as a starting point, chefs and a handful of franchise owners began weekly visits to the companyâ€™s kitchens in Chicago to meet with suppliers. First came the chicken breast. â€œWe looked at the Southern Chicken sandwich and knew it had to be modernized, reimagined from how it was,â€?said John Link, who began working at McDonaldâ€™s 50 years ago when he was 15 and today owns 13 restaurants in the Hickory, N.C., area. â€œWe would have 10 different profiles of sandwiches on a big table and we would take a bite and then rank the sandwiches,â€?Mr. Link said. â€œWe narrowed it down to two fillets. The suppliers were there and listened to what we were saying. I probably took six or eight trips to Chicago working on that fillet, just to get it right.â€?After the fillet, the focus turned to the bun. Fifteen to 20 varieties of buns and rolls were considered. More sandwiches were made and taste-tested. â€œIt was tons of buns,â€?Mr. Link said. Ultimately, McDonaldâ€™s decided, for the first time, to use a potato roll for one of its sandwiches. The roll is toasted with a creamy butter, dispensed through new warmers that are being installed in the restaurants. â€œItâ€™s sweet and buttery, a really nice complement to the savory of the chicken,â€?said Linda VanGosen, the head of U.S. menu strategy at McDonaldâ€™s. Last, but not least, came the two pickles. â€œI learned a lot about pickles,â€?Mr. Link said with a laugh, explaining that the crinkle-cut pickle McDonaldâ€™s uses means more crunch and more pickle flavor on the sandwich. Instead of the cardboard boxes that McDonaldâ€™s uses for most of its sandwiches, the original Crispy Chicken sandwich and the spicy version will be served in a foil bag. By late 2019, the new chicken sandwich was being tested in restaurants in Houston and Knoxville, Tenn. After successful test runs, plans were set to release the sandwiches last summer. But those plans were sidelined as the coronavirus pandemic swept across the country and franchise owners were focused on keeping their doors open and employees safe. â€œOur attention needed to be on serving our customers,â€?Ms. VanGosen said. â€œIt was just not the right time to launch.â€?Mr. Link said the sandwich would be worth the wait. â€œIâ€™m pretty passionate about chicken. Being from the South, I eat a lot of chicken,â€?he said. â€œI wanted a sandwich that, when I ate that sandwich, I wanted to take another bite.â€?

needs to make sure its burgers and coffee don't grow too expensive for customers, its chief executive said, as restaurant owners raise menu prices to offset their own rising costs...

Alex Roarty and Bianca PadrÃ³ Ocasio report in the Miami Herald on a new worry among Democrats: Liberal grassroots groups in Florida are reducing staff and scaling back voter-outreach efforts because of a growing reluctance from out-of-state donors to spend money on the state, say top progressive strategists.
But liberal strategists say that, while it's not too late to turn things around, what they're seeing now makes them concerned that Florida is entering a dangerous new phase, in which the failure of past elections saps resources for future races and makes winning even harder -- pushing the party into a kind of death spiral here that could turn a former swing state into one Republicans dominate for a generation.","There's been much to criticize lately in the behavior of corporate CEOs taking the path of least political resistance. And certainly among politicians there is no shortage of blame to go around Washington for the inflation that is ravaging consumers. Today brings refreshing news of a chief executive who seems to have the quaint notion that he should focus on serving the consumer. The Journal's Heather Haddon reports: McDonald's Corp. needs to make sure its burgers and coffee don't grow too expensive for customers, its chief executive said, as restaurant owners raise menu prices to offset their own rising costs... Restaurants and food companies are trying to balance raising prices to offset more expensive ingredients and wages against consumers' ability and willingness to pay higher prices. U.S. inflation hit a new four-decade high in March, driven by surging food and energy costs, as well as supply-chain constraints. McDonald's Chief Executive Chris Kempczinski said the company is focused on remaining a good value for diners, particularly for low-income customers who are more likely to notice inflation. ""We've always got to stay competitive on value,"" Mr. Kempczinski said. ""When we lose sight of that, there's a long history of that being where we've kind of gotten off track."" The latest demand to veer off track is coming from a billionaire who doesn't eat at McDonald's but wants to force a more expensive menu on the people who do. The Journal's Cara Lombardo recently reported: Carl Icahn is urging BlackRock Inc. and other big index-fund managers focused on socially conscious investing to support his proxy fight at McDonald's Corp. for better treatment of pregnant pigs. The billionaire activist investor, who has a McDonald's stake worth roughly $50,000, nominated two directors to the fast-food chain's board in February as part of his campaign, a departure from his typical fights for changes in financial strategy and the like... McDonald's says what Mr. Icahn is demanding is unfeasible because the company would require 300 to 400 times the number of animals currently housed without crates. It said such a move would significantly increase its costs and place a financial burden on its customers. Can you imagine the gall of someone sitting onan estimated $16 billion fortune claiming that it's ""socially conscious"" to force price increases on middle- and lower-income diners while inflation is raging at an annual rate of 8.5%? Fight on, Mr. Kempczinski! *** Remind Us Again Why We Should Trust an Iran Nuclear Deal McClatchy's Michael Wilner reports from Washington: Iran's attempts to assassinate former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are real and ongoing, his successor, Antony Blinken, told Congress on Tuesday. Testifying before a Senate panel, Blinken acknowledged details made public last month in a sensitive State Department report that outlined a security arrangement for the former secretary involving round-the-clock government protection. ""I'm not sure what I can say in an open setting, but let me say generically that there is an ongoing threat against American officials, both present and past,"" Blinken said.

McDonald's,MCD,2022/9/7,impacts on communities,"â€˜I Ended Islandâ€? Migrants Land Political Drama
â€œI thought I was coming to Boston,â€?he said.
Unlike Central American and Mexican migrants who have been immigrating to the United States in large numbers for a long time, Venezuelans are a recent phenomenon and often have no family or friends to receive them.
â€œI left my country to support my family,â€?said Mr. Nazareth, a 34-year-old construction worker.
â€œI decided I would do anything to provide for my daughters,â€?he said.
I love Massachusetts!â€?His plan: â€œI want to start working as soon as possible.â€?Carlos Guanaguanay, 25, said that he and two friends were strolling through the aisles of a supermarket near the shelter in San Antonio a few days ago when a woman approached them.
â€œWe said that we were looking for work.â€?Three days later, they were traveling on a bus from the La Quinta hotel with other Venezuelans to board a Massachusetts-bound flight.
â€œWe faced hunger, slept in the streets but we have arrived,â€?said Mr. Guanaguanay, a motorcycle mechanic.
â€œI want to get to work, thatâ€™s all I want now,â€?he said, â€œand if I can do that here, Iâ€™ll stay on the island.â€?Dependent on a robust tourism industry, the islandâ€™s population swells from about 20,000 year-round residents to about 150,000 during the summer months.
â€œWe are meeting their needs for food, shelter, and we are definitely supplying them with a lot of love,â€?said Lisa Belcastro, the manager of the only homeless shelter on the island.
A man named Luis who had journeyed from the northern Venezuelan state of Lara with nine family members â€?including his wife, brothers and cousins â€?said they traveled through seven countries before making it to San Antonio and boarding the flight to Massachusetts.
Luis, who did not want to share his surname out of concern for his safety, said that after spending three days in San Antonio, his family also encountered a blonde woman in the street who said her name was Perla.
When the pilot announced they were about to land on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, the migrants were shocked, Luis said: â€œThatâ€™s the first time we heard that.â€?He broke down in tears when he got to the island.
Like other migrants, his family has paperwork from border authorities informing them to report to an immigration office within 15 days, and the man said he feared that his family had been tricked into flying to the island to then be deported.
Mr. Castillo said he politely declined because he intended to stay in San Antonio for the time being and later travel to Houston to find work, he said.
â€œShe said it was Massa-something,â€?Mr. Castillo recalled on Thursday while standing outside a shelter run by the city.
We are going to stay here until we figure out how to find transportation,â€?Mr. Lopez said.","After long, perilous journeys, Venezuelans unexpectedly found themselves on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, wondering what comes next. Ardenis Nazareth, newly arrived from Venezuela, was standing in a McDonaldâ€™s parking lot across the street from a San Antonio shelter a few days ago contemplating his next steps. After a monthslong odyssey through seven countries he had finally made it to the United States. It was time to banish from his thoughts the worst moments â€?when he was robbed at gunpoint and people dropped dead of exhaustion beside him as they crossed a lawless jungle, and when he watched helplessly as his friend was swallowed by the turbulent waters of the Rio Grande, just before touching U.S. soil in Texas. Now Mr. Nazareth had one objective in mind: make money to support the two young daughters he had left behind. That is when a well-dressed woman who introduced herself as Perla handed him and about 30 other migrants gift cards for the fast-food restaurant, which they gladly accepted. Then she made an enticing offer: a free flight to a â€œsanctuary,â€?he recalled, where there were people to help them get on their feet. The place was called Massachusetts. Was that close to New York, Mr. Nazareth asked. She assured him that it was, and that onward travel would be available, if that is where he hoped to settle. Yet he was surprised when he found himself on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, a small, picturesque vacation destination in the Atlantic. â€œI thought I was coming to Boston,â€?he said. â€œI ended up on this little island.â€?He also ended up in the middle of a political drama that escalated this week when Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas sent two busloads of migrants to Vice President Kamala Harrisâ€™s residence in Washington and Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida sent two planeloads of migrants to Marthaâ€™s Vineyard. Republican governors in border states have sent thousands of migrants to New York and Washington, arguing that Democratic enclaves whose leaders support more liberal immigration policies should share the responsibility of caring for them. That tactic is causing chaos in cities faced with unexpected arrivals, and changing the trajectory of the lives of individuals, like Mr. Nazareth. Mr. Nazareth recalled that the woman he met at McDonaldâ€™s went table to table making the same offer. Before long, Mr. Nazareth and seven other Venezuelans climbed into a van driven by the woman to reach an airport hotel. More Venezuelans checked in over the following days, until about 50 were placed on charter flights on Wednesday that delivered them to Marthaâ€™s Vineyard. Venezuelans have been fleeing their country amid political and economic turmoil that has caused widespread deprivation. Nearly seven million Venezuelans, more than a fifth of the population, make up the largest international displacement in the hemisphereâ€™s history. Unlike Central American and Mexican migrants who have been immigrating to the United States in large numbers for a long time, Venezuelans are a recent phenomenon and often have no family or friends to receive them. The U.S. Border Patrol encountered 110,467 Venezuelans along the southern border in the first nine months of this fiscal year, compared with 47,408 in the entire 2021 fiscal year. They now represent the fastest-growing migrant group to the United States. Tens of thousands have embarked on a perilous route over land through the Darien Gap along the Colombia-Panama border. â€œI left my country to support my family,â€?said Mr. Nazareth, a 34-year-old construction worker. He said that since leaving his home country 18 months ago he had tried to make a living in Peru and Chile. But he could not make ends meet, and word spread among his friends that Venezuelans were managing to enter the United States, where jobs were plentiful. â€œI decided I would do anything to provide for my daughters,â€?he said. More than 100 Venezuelans set out together, he said. During the jungle crossing, they survived on unripe mango, green bananas and iguanas, he said, after they ran out of food. Thugs robbed most of the money he carried, about $300, he said. After being harassed by Mexican officials, who demanded bribes, he said, he and his group arrived in Piedras Negras, Mexico, across from Texas, where they intended to turn themselves in to U.S. border authorities. The last leg of their trip was the Rio Grande. As they began to wade across, ropes affixed to their waists, the currents intensified and the water quickly rose to their chins. Mr. Nazarethâ€™s travel companion, Cesar, 22, suddenly slipped away, and was later found dead. On Thursday, Mr. Nazareth expressed gratitude for the warm reception that he and his brethren had received in Marthaâ€™s Vineyard. â€œTheyâ€™re treating us super well,â€?he said. â€œWeâ€™re getting food, clothing, all our needs met. I love Massachusetts!â€?His plan: â€œI want to start working as soon as possible.â€?Carlos Guanaguanay, 25, said that he and two friends were strolling through the aisles of a supermarket near the shelter in San Antonio a few days ago when a woman approached them. â€œShe asked us what we were doing here,â€?he recalled. â€œWe said that we were looking for work.â€?Three days later, they were traveling on a bus from the La Quinta hotel with other Venezuelans to board a Massachusetts-bound flight. â€œWe faced hunger, slept in the streets but we have arrived,â€?said Mr. Guanaguanay, a motorcycle mechanic. He had a 4-year-old daughter and wife back home. â€œI want to get to work, thatâ€™s all I want now,â€?he said, â€œand if I can do that here, Iâ€™ll stay on the island.â€?Dependent on a robust tourism industry, the islandâ€™s population swells from about 20,000 year-round residents to about 150,000 during the summer months. With that shift comes a dramatic drop in jobs in the off-season. The migrants arrived just as the busy season ended and during one of the worst affordable housing shortages in the islandâ€™s history. The church where they are staying is home to the sole homeless shelter on the island. St. Andrewâ€™s sits in a quiet corner of Edgartown, off the main drag where summer visitors feast on dripping ice cream and oysters. The parishâ€™s two buildings straddle a narrow, one-way street that on Thursday was crammed with police cruisers, immigration lawyers, translators, news cameras and a few dozen volunteers. Island residents stopped by throughout the day to donate food, clothes and shoes. Just behind the parish, a crew of Brazilian laborers, a large immigrant work force on the island, was renovating a two-story home. â€œWe are meeting their needs for food, shelter, and we are definitely supplying them with a lot of love,â€?said Lisa Belcastro, the manager of the only homeless shelter on the island. â€œThey need to be off island. Their immigration appointments are not here.â€?Ms. Belcastro said they would be moved elsewhere, but when remains a question. A man named Luis who had journeyed from the northern Venezuelan state of Lara with nine family members â€?including his wife, brothers and cousins â€?said they traveled through seven countries before making it to San Antonio and boarding the flight to Massachusetts. Luis, who did not want to share his surname out of concern for his safety, said that after spending three days in San Antonio, his family also encountered a blonde woman in the street who said her name was Perla. The woman, he said, told them she was affiliated with a foundation that helped transport refugees to sanctuary cities and could book them on a flight to Massachusetts. One caveat: They could not take any pictures. When the pilot announced they were about to land on Marthaâ€™s Vineyard, the migrants were shocked, Luis said: â€œThatâ€™s the first time we heard that.â€?He broke down in tears when he got to the island. Like other migrants, his family has paperwork from border authorities informing them to report to an immigration office within 15 days, and the man said he feared that his family had been tricked into flying to the island to then be deported. Venezuelan migrants surrender to border officials once they cross into the United States, and later request asylum. Since the United States has no diplomatic relations with their home country, they are generally allowed to stay, rather than face expedited deportation like many migrants from Mexico and Central America. After reaching their destinations, the migrants can remain in the United States for months or even years while they await the outcome of their asylum cases, and they are allowed to work while they pursue asylum claims. But they must comply with instructions to appear in court or check in with immigration authorities, or they jeopardize their cases. Back in San Antonio, Luis Amador Castillo, 34, recalled that he and a friend, Francisco, had crossed the street to the McDonaldâ€™s near the shelter. A woman handed them bottles of water and gift cards from the restaurant. Are you interested in a free hotel stay and a free flight to Massachusetts? she asked with a smile. There are people waiting for you with food, shelter and ready to help you with whatever you need, the woman told them, Mr. Castillo recalled. Francisco jumped at the idea. Mr. Castillo said he politely declined because he intended to stay in San Antonio for the time being and later travel to Houston to find work, he said. He recalled that the name of the place she mentioned sounded funny at first. â€œShe said it was Massa-something,â€?Mr. Castillo recalled on Thursday while standing outside a shelter run by the city. Steps away from him, Xavier Lopez, 20, and his girlfriend, Maria Perez, 21, said they regretted missing a free flight. The pair left Venezuela in late May with their 2-year-old son, Santiago. â€œWe donâ€™t have money to go anywhere. We are going to stay here until we figure out how to find transportation,â€?Mr. Lopez said. â€œIf I knew there was a person offering free flights to Miami, that would be ideal for us.â€?Miriam Jordan reported from Los Angeles, and Remy Tumin from Edgartown, Mass. Will Sennott contributed reporting from Edgartown, and Edgar Sandoval from San Antonio. Miriam Jordan reported from Los Angeles, and Remy Tumin from Edgartown, Mass.

Gov. Ron DeSantis's migrant flights
Her name was Perla, she said.
Nearly two weeks later, though, Jose is one of dozens of migrants who now question Perla's efforts to entice them onto a flight that unexpectedly ended on the wealthy island of Martha's Vineyard â€?a political operation engineered by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to gin up outrage over the United States' border crisis.
Florida officials began researching Texas's migrant situation weeks before the flights, and a contractor with ties to the DeSantis administration later handled the efforts.
""I don't like the way they treated us,"" said Jose, who made the journey to the border with two stuffed animals given to him as a gift by his 5-year old son, whom he left behind with relatives.
But DeSantis also faces legal challenges, including an investigation by a Texas sheriff, who called it a ""predatory"" operation, a federal class-action lawsuit by the migrants alleging a ""premeditated, fraudulent, and illegal scheme,"" and a Democratic lawmaker's state lawsuit challenging the governor's use of a $12 million migrant relocation fund.
Florida officials ""reached out to better understand the mission, see how it is being carried out and learn more on efforts they may be able to replicate in their own state,"" said Ericka Miller, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety.
""All I wanted was for my daughter to have a better life,"" who spoke on the condition that she be identified only by her first name for fear of retribution from those involved in the migrant flights, said in Spanish.
He hiked past the corpses of migrants who died during the same journey, he said, and lost his phone in a river.
Like many other migrants, Jose lacked a plan when he was forced to leave the shelter after three days.
Speaking in English and Spanish, Jose said, she offered them a 90-day stay in a ""sanctuary"" city that welcomes migrants.
""We had been living on the street for two days, and we were getting desperate,"" Estrella said of her encounter with Perla.
""I can take you where you're going,"" he said Perla told him.
""I could shower, I could get dressed,"" Jose said.
Perla offered migrants $10 McDonald's gift cards if they signed waivers in which ""an entire paragraph about liability and transport"" and ""language specifying that the journey would take place from Texas to Massachusetts"" was not completely translated into Spanish, according to the class-action suit.
Jose said the forms he signed were in English and that he couldn't read them.
Perla told them she would return early the next day, Jose said.
""I just wanted to get to Philadelphia,"" he said.
One migrant asked if they could go to New York and was told they were headed to Washington, D.C., or another ""sanctuary state,"" according to the class-action suit.
Perla told Jose they were headed to Massachusetts, he said.
When the migrants arrived, a black van was waiting for them outside, Jose said.
A woman who answered the door didn't speak Spanish, and her look of surprise sent the group into a panic, Jose said.
""People wanted to run away,"" Jose said.
""If I tell you how I felt, I want to cry,"" Jose said.
I just wanted to get to Philadelphia."" Migrants tried to reach Perla, but they said she didn't pick up.
Call the churches."" Jose and other migrants were furious at the betrayal, but he said the people on Martha's Vineyard quickly assuaged their fears.
""If you have folks that are inclined to think Florida is a good place, our message to them is we are not a sanctuary state,"" he said.
""And yes, we will help facilitate that transport for you to be able to go to greener pastures."" Rachel Self, a Boston lawyer aiding the migrants, said they had been told ""there was a surprise present for them"" upon arrival.
Meanwhile, recruiters were again looking for migrants outside the San Antonio shelter, witnesses said.
The Rev. Gavin Rogers of Travis Park Church in San Antonio said his staff was contacted by migrants last week who had been recruited by a woman calling herself ""Perla"" and sent to another La Quinta hotel.
Rogers said a bus took some of the migrants back to the shelter.
""Some decided to go their own ways."" DeSantis's office has not said whether the canceled Delaware flight was part of the state's operation.
But he is upset with DeSantis and the ""remote control"" team of Perla and other recruiters who he said tricked them into getting on the planes.","When Jose joined the migrants behind a McDonald's on a sunbaked San Antonio street earlier this month, he was running out of options. The 27-year-old had survived the perilous trek from Venezuela and safely crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, but now he had no place to go. Like the others behind the restaurant on Sept. 8, he'd been kicked out of a shelter after three days. Immigration officials had warned them they couldn't work legally yet. No one had any money to get to distant cities where friends or family might help. That's when a smiling blond-haired woman in a cowboy hat approached. Her name was Perla, she said. And she could fix all their troubles. It was a pitch Perla had been making to other newly homeless migrants huddled on San Antonio's streets. She drove a rented white SUV and promised food, jobs and transportation. Jose trusted her. For the first time since coming to the United States, he felt safe. ""We thought she was a good person,"" he told The Washington Post. Nearly two weeks later, though, Jose is one of dozens of migrants who now question Perla's efforts to entice them onto a flight that unexpectedly ended on the wealthy island of Martha's Vineyard â€?a political operation engineered by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to gin up outrage over the United States' border crisis. Much remains unknown about the effort. While DeSantis has embraced his role in staging the flight, arguing that it protected Florida from ""negative ramifications"" of a border crossing surge, his office has been less clear about the purpose of nearly $1.6 million paid to a contractor, according to state records, and the role of state officials in developing the plan. But Post interviews with several migrants directly recruited by Perla, as well as court documents and state records, paint a picture of a carefully orchestrated, taxpayer-funded operation with little apparent concern for the interests of the migrants caught in the middle. Florida officials began researching Texas's migrant situation weeks before the flights, and a contractor with ties to the DeSantis administration later handled the efforts. Some migrants, meanwhile, say they were misled into signing documents after being lured into the trip with food and hotel stays. ""I don't like the way they treated us,"" said Jose, who made the journey to the border with two stuffed animals given to him as a gift by his 5-year old son, whom he left behind with relatives. ""We're human beings."" DeSantis has reaped political benefits, grabbing center stage on an issue that once helped propel Donald Trump to the White House and putting Democrats on defense over the nation's chaotic and overstressed immigration system. Republican leaders have embraced his tactics and begun fundraising off pledges to fly migrants to other blue-state enclaves. But DeSantis also faces legal challenges, including an investigation by a Texas sheriff, who called it a ""predatory"" operation, a federal class-action lawsuit by the migrants alleging a ""premeditated, fraudulent, and illegal scheme,"" and a Democratic lawmaker's state lawsuit challenging the governor's use of a $12 million migrant relocation fund. The governor has brushed off the claims, saying all of the migrants got on the plane voluntarily. ""It is opportunistic that activists would use illegal immigrants for political theater,"" his office said in a statement. ""Florida's program gave them a fresh start in a sanctuary state."" Days before the flight landed in Martha's Vineyard, DeSantis had given not-so-subtle hints about his plans. Speaking to a room of major GOP donors at the Four Seasons hotel in Orlando, he mused about going to Texas to ""help."" Border crossers might be rounded up and sent somewhere â€?possibly to the wealthy island of Martha's Vineyard. ""Who knows?"" he teased. An extraordinary plan had already been set in motion. The backdrop was the record surge of migrants who have crossed the southern U.S. border this year, driven by soaring violence and poverty in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba. Last week, border authorities topped 2 million arrests for the year, the most ever. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) has responded to the influx by dispatching thousands of migrants on buses to far flung, Democratic-rich locales. In August, Florida law enforcement officials traveled to the Texas border cities of Del Rio and Eagle Pass to meet with staff from two Texas agencies involved in the state's migrant busing program. Florida officials ""reached out to better understand the mission, see how it is being carried out and learn more on efforts they may be able to replicate in their own state,"" said Ericka Miller, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public Safety. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokesperson declined to say whether the Texas trips were tied to the migrant flights this month, citing an ongoing grand jury investigation into illegal immigration. Thousands of those who make it into the United States have ended up at the Migrant Resource Center in downtown San Antonio. The shelter can house 600 people and has served more than 24,000 migrants since it opened in July. In early September, it was packed as usual with new arrivals. Yerkyn Torres, 36, had left behind his wife and two children in Venezuela to spare them the arduous journey. A 40-year-old woman named Estrella had come from Peru with her 7-year-old daughter. ""All I wanted was for my daughter to have a better life,"" who spoke on the condition that she be identified only by her first name for fear of retribution from those involved in the migrant flights, said in Spanish. ""That's all I was thinking as I got her across that river."" As Jose gave his account in Spanish of what happened, accompanied by his lawyer Julio HenrÃ­quez, he spoke on the condition that he be identified only by his middle name because of fear of retribution against family in Venezuela and from the Americans who he says misled him. Jose had been a petrochemical engineering student in Venezuela but dropped out when he couldn't afford the tuition. Then in December, he said a criminal gang stabbed him in front of his aunt's candy shop, where he worked, allegedly because his family was linked to anti-government groups. He escaped in February, traveling by bus and on foot to Peru, where his grandmother had taken his son. But he said the gang was still after him, so in June, his family paid for a bus ticket to Colombia to begin the journey that finally brought him to San Antonio. He described fording knee-deep mud in the jungles of the DariÃ©n Gap linking Colombia and Panama. He hiked past the corpses of migrants who died during the same journey, he said, and lost his phone in a river. Then he walked and hitchhiked through Central America and Mexico into the border city of Matamoros, across a bridge from Brownsville, Tex., where he surrendered to authorities and was detained for several days. Like many other migrants, Jose lacked a plan when he was forced to leave the shelter after three days. Immigration officers had released him after an aunt's friend in Philadelphia promised to take him in, but he had no money to get there. Immigration officers told him he had to check in with them on Sept. 28 in Philadelphia or face deportation. For now, he slept on the street. Enter Perla. Perla never gave migrants her last name. But according to the migrants, she was as persuasive as they were desperate. Speaking in English and Spanish, Jose said, she offered them a 90-day stay in a ""sanctuary"" city that welcomes migrants. She said they had steady jobs for 50 people in fields such as cleaning and carpentry. ""We had been living on the street for two days, and we were getting desperate,"" Estrella said of her encounter with Perla. When Jose met her outside the McDonald's, he told her he needed to reach Philadelphia, where an aunt's friend had offered to put him up. ""I can take you where you're going,"" he said Perla told him. ""She was very nice. It looked like everything she was saying was true."" She left and didn't come back for two days. Then, on a Saturday afternoon, she returned and offered to take eight people to a hotel. Jose jumped at the chance. The La Quinta was a respite. There were real beds, a swimming pool and a breakfast buffet. Perla brought them pizza and hamburgers at night. ""I could shower, I could get dressed,"" Jose said. He swam in the pool. Perla offered migrants $10 McDonald's gift cards if they signed waivers in which ""an entire paragraph about liability and transport"" and ""language specifying that the journey would take place from Texas to Massachusetts"" was not completely translated into Spanish, according to the class-action suit. Jose said the forms he signed were in English and that he couldn't read them. Perla told them she would return early the next day, Jose said. About 50 people would board buses to the airport and then take two chartered planes to Massachusetts. ""I just wanted to get to Philadelphia,"" he said. The next morning, Sept. 14, they were taken to an airport. There was no security, and no X-ray machine. It was Jose's first time on an airplane and he began to feel uneasy. He turned, searching for Perla. ""I saw that she was saying, 'Ciao!' "" he said. ""I said, 'You're not coming with us?' "" She said no, but others, someone of Cuban descent and Puerto Rican or Dominican descent, would guide them. There was confusion about where they were going. One migrant asked if they could go to New York and was told they were headed to Washington, D.C., or another ""sanctuary state,"" according to the class-action suit. Perla told Jose they were headed to Massachusetts, he said. First, though, the planes stopped in Crestview, Fla. The small Panhandle town is near the Destin, Fla., offices of Vertol Systems, a politically connected aviation company. Larry Keefe, DeSantis's ""public safety czar"" who heads his immigration crackdown, previously represented Vertol in a dozen lawsuits, the Miami Herald found. Neither Keefe nor a Vertol executive immediately responded to requests for comment. Under the ""relocation program for unauthorized aliens,"" the state Department of Transportation paid Vertol $615,000 on Sept. 8, and then another $950,000 on Sept. 19, public records show. The payments exceed the typical cost of a charter flight, experts said, but the governor's office and the company have not responded to questions about how exactly the money was spent. One of the pilots was of Colombian descent, Jose said, and the staff served sodas and crackers. Some migrants worried they were being taken to a remote location. Would it be safe? Just a few minutes before landing, the pilot's voice came over the loudspeaker: The destination was Martha's Vineyard. ""That was the first time we found out where we'd be going,"" Torres said. Many had never heard of the island known as a summer sanctuary for the well-to-do. The passengers were handed shiny red folders. Among the contents: a brochure titled ""Massachusetts Refugee Benefits"" imprinted with a proposed redesign of the state flag that a resident uploaded to the internet on a whim, according to the Boston Globe, and a rudimentary U.S. map with an arrow drawn from Central Texas to Martha's Vineyard. ""YOU ARE HERE. . . ESTA AQUI."" There was also a ""Welcome to Massachusetts"" map that identified landmarks irrelevant to the migrants' urgent needs, including Lucy Vincent Beach and the Featherstone Center for the Arts. The planes landed around 3 p.m. ""Unannounced, except at most, for the flights' notification to the local air traffic controller,"" according to the class-action suit. When the migrants arrived, a black van was waiting for them outside, Jose said. It dropped the migrants off outside of the nonprofit Martha's Vineyard Community Services. A woman who answered the door didn't speak Spanish, and her look of surprise sent the group into a panic, Jose said. She had not been expecting them. They were not supposed to be there. ""People wanted to run away,"" Jose said. But when they looked at the map in the red folder, he said, they realized, ""we were surrounded by pure water."" Torres started to think he had been tricked by the government into missing his upcoming immigration date in Texas. ""I just want to start working so I can find a place to sleep,"" he said in Spanish. ""If I tell you how I felt, I want to cry,"" Jose said. ""I felt destroyed inside, tricked, frightened. I didn't know if they were going to put me in jail, if they'd deport me. I just wanted to get to Philadelphia."" Migrants tried to reach Perla, but they said she didn't pick up. So they tried the Venezuelan man who had been recruiting them alongside her. He forwarded a recorded voice message from Perla urging the migrants not to worry. ""They have to take charge of you,"" she said. ""Stay calm. They will take care of you. You have the numbers of the churches. Call the churches."" Jose and other migrants were furious at the betrayal, but he said the people on Martha's Vineyard quickly assuaged their fears. A man who spoke Spanish told them not to worry. ""He said don't despair. We didn't expect you, but you're here. We're going to help you,"" Jose recalled. Lisa Belcastro, coordinator of a homeless shelter at a nearby church, began mobilizing dozens of volunteers. Local residents donated food, clothing and suitcases. Belcastro made sure there were enough beds. Belcastro wanted to make sure the group got a good night's sleep, so she stayed overnight. Lights out at 10 p.m. ""They aren't just refugees or numbers,"" she said. ""They're human beings that we care about."" Lawyers worked to make sure migrants could update their addresses, to prevent being punished for missing immigration appointments and to pursue asylum claims. Shortly before midnight, a deputy press secretary for DeSantis, Jeremy Redfern, tweeted a picture of former president Barack Obama's home on Martha's Vineyard: ""7 bedrooms with 8 and a half bathrooms in a 6,892-square-foot house on nearly 30 acres. Plenty of space."" At a news conference the next morning, DeSantis was put on the spot. ""Gov. DeSantis, can you elaborate on reports of deploying dozens of migrants over to Martha's Vineyard?"" asked a television reporter, as the crowd cheered. DeSantis owned up. ""If you have folks that are inclined to think Florida is a good place, our message to them is we are not a sanctuary state,"" he said. ""And yes, we will help facilitate that transport for you to be able to go to greener pastures."" Rachel Self, a Boston lawyer aiding the migrants, said they had been told ""there was a surprise present for them"" upon arrival. ""This was obviously a sadistic lie,"" she said. Meanwhile, recruiters were again looking for migrants outside the San Antonio shelter, witnesses said. The Rev. Gavin Rogers of Travis Park Church in San Antonio said his staff was contacted by migrants last week who had been recruited by a woman calling herself ""Perla"" and sent to another La Quinta hotel. They were waiting for a flight to Delaware that was ultimately canceled, the Miami Herald reported, in a hotel room booked in Perla's name. Rogers said a bus took some of the migrants back to the shelter. ""Some reached out to us, and we did offer them a place to be,"" Rogers said. ""Some decided to go their own ways."" DeSantis's office has not said whether the canceled Delaware flight was part of the state's operation. After two nights at the church shelter on Martha's Vineyard, it was time to get on another bus. This one would take the migrants to a ferry on their way to a nearby military base. Many cried. Migrants filed out of the parish to hugs from volunteers and new cellphones. Donors had provided underwear, purple T-shirts and hats from the local high school and Boston Red Sox apparel. They cheered as each person boarded. ""Without these people here, I don't know where we'd be,"" Eliomar Aguero, 30, said. ""Now, we just want to find jobs. But we are just so relieved to be here."" On the base, Jose said he is meeting with lawyers and attending medical appointments. He said he is eager to learn English and pursue his immigration case. ""We feel free,"" he said. But he is upset with DeSantis and the ""remote control"" team of Perla and other recruiters who he said tricked them into getting on the planes. The lawyers helped him switch his court case from Philadelphia to Boston. The friend who was going to take him in has moved away, so he is hoping to find a permanent place to live in Massachusetts. ""The fear I have is that these are political problems, you know,"" he said. ""We're not objects so that they operate us this way.""

Nearly every state, as well as more than 2,500 cities, counties, Native American tribes and other groups, have sued parts of the drug industry in state and federal courts. They are seeking billions of dollars to help them cope with the costs ofan epidemic that has taken more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades. Companies agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in several settlements reached last year alone. Purdue Pharma, manufacturer of OxyContin, is attempting work out a much larger deal in federal bankruptcy court to resolve all the legal actions against the company and its owners, the Sackler family. In the only case that has come to trial, Oklahoma Judge Thad Balkman ruled against Johnson & Johnson, ordering the company to pay $465 million for one year's worth of efforts to address the harm he said the company had caused. Both sides have appealed. Before that trial began, Oklahoma also settled with manufacturers Purdue and Teva Pharmaceuticals for a total of $355 million. Last week, the state reached an $8.75 million settlement with another drug manufacturer, Endo Pharmaceuticals. Now the state has turned to the three wholesalers, which control 85 percent of the drug distribution market in the United States. Federal laws and regulations assign them the primary responsibility for detecting, halting and reporting suspicious orders of narcotics from pharmacies, clinicians and others. In its lawsuit, Oklahoma claims the three companies violated a similar state law and their ""common law duty to exercise reasonable care in delivering dangerous narcotic substances"" by failing to take those actions. The state also accuses the companies of attempting to conceal their conduct. Unlike its lawsuit against the manufacturers, which sought funds to address future problems, the state this time is seeking payment to compensate for the damage it contends already has been done. The lawsuit cites the quantities of narcotics delivered by the companies from 2006 to 2012, including in Jefferson County, whose population is just over 6,100. Over that period, the companies delivered more than 4 million pain pills there, enough for every person to have more than 90 doses annually, the lawsuit contends. leonard.bernstein@washpost.com","<Incident Category>: controversial products and services, fraud, violation of national legislation, negligence, opioids

Congress is calling on federal officials to review the plans of four large drug companies to deduct the cost of a landmark opioid settlement from their taxes, after its year-long investigation into corporate disclosures first revealed in an analysis by The Washington Post.
""The committee's investigation shows that four companies that contributed to an opioid crisis that has killed half a million Americans and continues to claim tens of thousands of lives every year may now be attempting to put taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in settlement costs,"" the members said in the letter.
""Our nationwide settlement with a majority of U.S. states and territories will directly support state and local efforts to make meaningful progress in addressing the opioid crisis."" Cardinal Health spokesman Erich Timmerman said in an email the company has been forthright about its approach to tax obligations related to opioids, which he said is permissible under federal law.
""If the $26 billion settlement at issue is related to violations of federal, state, or local law, then these companies should not be allowed to shift the financial burden of the damage they have caused to American taxpayers,"" committee members said in the letter.
Cardinal Health, which agreed to pay $6 billion in the final settlement, has said it plans to use the Cares Act tax provision to increase the size of its opioid settlement tax benefit by $420 million, filings show.","Congress is calling on federal officials to review the plans of four large drug companies to deduct the cost of a landmark opioid settlement from their taxes, after its year-long investigation into corporate disclosures first revealed in an analysis by The Washington Post. On Thursday, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform sent a letter asking the Justice and Treasury departments to examine planned deductions from Johnson & Johnson, McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen. The four firms are seeking tax breaks that would help offset the cost of a $26 billion legal settlement finalized last month, to bring funds to communities hurt by the opioid epidemic. ""The committee's investigation shows that four companies that contributed to an opioid crisis that has killed half a million Americans and continues to claim tens of thousands of lives every year may now be attempting to put taxpayers on the hook for billions of dollars in settlement costs,"" the members said in the letter. ""This would be an outrageous tax benefit to line the pockets of bad corporate actors."" McKesson said in regulatory filings that it plans to claim a $1.4 billion tax benefit, while AmerisourceBergen plans to claim $1.1 billion, and Johnson & Johnson plans to claim $1.1 billion. Cardinal Health has filed for a $974 million tax refund but cautioned in a recent filing ""it is possible that the tax authorities could challenge these tax benefits."" In an email, Jake Sargent, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman, acknowledged that the opioid crisis is ""a public health issue that requires a public health response,"" he said. ""Our nationwide settlement with a majority of U.S. states and territories will directly support state and local efforts to make meaningful progress in addressing the opioid crisis."" Cardinal Health spokesman Erich Timmerman said in an email the company has been forthright about its approach to tax obligations related to opioids, which he said is permissible under federal law. Spokespeople for McKesson and AmerisourceBergen declined to comment. Nicole Navas Oxman, a Justice Department spokeswoman, confirmed that the agency ""has received the letter and will review it."" Alexandra LaManna, a Treasury Department spokeswoman, declined to comment. There is uncertainty in the law about these types of tax breaks, said Matthew Gardner, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Though recent changes to the tax code have attempted to close loopholes that permit companies to deduct legal settlements or governmental fines from taxes when they have committed wrongdoing, many firms push to make sure their settlements include a ""restitution"" payment for victims, a measure that often qualifies them for deductions, Gardner said. All four firms agreed to pay ""compensatory restitution"" payments to the victims of the opioid crisis but disavowed any legal liability or wrongdoing, according to the language in their final settlement agreements. The companies said they produced government-approved prescription pills, distributed them to registered pharmacies and took steps to try to prevent their misuse. In their letter, House members questioned the legality of the deductions. Damages paid to government entities as the result of a government investigation into a potential violation of law are generally not eligible for deduction, the lawmakers said, citing the U.S. tax code. The lawsuits brought by thousands of states, localities and tribes alleged that drugmakers engaged in false and misleading marketing about the dangers of their products and that drug distributors failed to report the misuse of their products to authorities. ""If the $26 billion settlement at issue is related to violations of federal, state, or local law, then these companies should not be allowed to shift the financial burden of the damage they have caused to American taxpayers,"" committee members said in the letter. The lawmakers expressed particular concern over Cardinal Health's ""highly questionable"" plan to use a tax provision Congress included in last year's Cares Act relief package, intended to help companies struggling during the pandemic. Cardinal Health, which agreed to pay $6 billion in the final settlement, has said it plans to use the Cares Act tax provision to increase the size of its opioid settlement tax benefit by $420 million, filings show. Early in the pandemic, Congress expanded the ability for companies to receive tax refunds on losses to quickly get cash to businesses facing economic peril. Because there were few restrictions, billions of dollars in tax breaks have gone to companies that laid off thousands of workers and firms largely unaffected by the pandemic. There is little evidence the tax relief has trickled down into the pockets of struggling families. Cardinal Health, a company with a $15 billion market capitalization, grew its revenue in each of the past two years, according to regulatory filings. It has over $3 billion in cash available. In response to a question from Congress about whether its tax deduction was consistent with the ""intent"" of the Cares Act, Jessica Mayer, chief legal and compliance officer for Cardinal, pointed out that the law says nothing about tax breaks being available only to companies in poor financial condition. ""Neither the text of the Cares Act nor the legislative history or IRS rulings would prohibit the application of the Cares Act provisions to facts such as ours,"" Mayer said in Cardinal's response letter last year. As part of its investigation last year, the House committee asked drug companies to provide ""a complete list of current and former employees who have been disciplined"" for their roles in opioid sales and compliance programs. In response, ""none of the companies identified meaningful discipline taken against their executives,"" the members said in their letter this week.

The three companies will also pay $40 million in attorneys' fees. The state had accused McKesson of failing to prevent the diversion of opioids for illicit purposes, and the drugmakers of engaging in deceptive marketing practices that downplayed the addiction risks of their painkillers. The companies have denied wrongdoing. J&J, which manufactured the pain medications Duragesic and Nucynta, said it no longer sells prescription opioids in the United States and that its past marketing efforts were ""appropriate and responsible."" McKesson and Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Alabama was one of four states that declined to join a nationwide $26 billion settlement of opioid litigation by McKesson, two other top U.S. distributors and J&J that was finalized in February.  â€œThese three settlement agreements affirm my decision to decline participation in the national opioid settlements, which did not adequately acknowledge the unique harm that Alabamians have endured,"" Marshall said in a statement. Alabama will get more from McKesson and a faster payout from J&J, compared to what the state would have received under the national settlement, Marshall said. Alabama would have received $115 million over 18 years from McKesson under the national settlement framework, and J&J would have paid $70.3 million over nine years. Under the new settlement, J&J will now make full payment within a year, while McKesson will pay within nine years, Marshall said. The state had been on the verge of a trial against McKesson, with opening arguments scheduled for Monday before the two sides requested a delay. The Alabama deal comes amid a wave of litigation and settlement by state governments over the U.S. opioid crisis, which has led to more than 500,000 overdose deaths over two decades, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. West Virginia on Monday announced a $99 million settlement with J&J , and is in the midst of a trial against drugmakers Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and AbbVie's Allergan unit. Florida reached more than $878 million in opioid settlements with CVS Health Corp and three drug companies in March, and began a trial against pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance on April 11.

(Reuters) -Washington has reached a $518 million settlement with drug distributors McKesson Corp, AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health Inc, ending a months-long trial over the companies' alleged role in fueling the opioid epidemic in the state.
The state previously said it would have received $417.9 million from McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen under that settlement.

McKesson will pay $197 million, while AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal will each contribute $160.5 million to the settlement. Washington had opted out of a $26 billion nationwide opioid settlement involving the three largest U.S. drug distributors and Johnson & Johnson. The state previously said it would have received $417.9 million from McKesson, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen under that settlement. The settlement is one of the largest in Washington State history, state Attorney General Bob Ferguson said in a news conference. ""We could have joined the overwhelming majority of states and settled with the largest opioid distributors, but we chose to fight them in court instead,"" Ferguson said. ""That decision to take them to court will result in significant additional resources for Washington to combat the opioid epidemic."" The state had accused the three companies of failing to prevent prescription pills from being diverted for illegal use during a trial that began in November before King County Superior Court Judge Michael Scott in Seattle. Washington had sought $38.2 billion to fund public health initiatives related to opioid addiction. Despite falling far short of its trial demands, Washington improved on the previous settlement offer without risking a loss in court, Ferguson said. ""It would be a bad day for the state of Washington if I take that risk and I lose,"" Ferguson said. The settlement will become final if all Washington's political subdivisions agree to participate before a September 2022 deadline. If the settlement is finalized, the drug distributor payments will be spread over 17 years. The distributors, who deny wrongdoing, said the settlement would provide meaningful relief to communities impacted by the opioid epidemic in the United States, which has caused more than 500,000 overdose deaths over the past two decades, according government data. Washington state will continue to bring lawsuits against companies that contributed to the opioid crisis, Ferguson said. The state expects to go to trial against J&J in September. Other states that opted out of the broader nationwide settlement include Alabama and Oklahoma. West Virginia was not eligible to join the national agreement because of a prior settlement between the state and the three distributors. Alabama recently reached settlements with McKesson and J&J, while West Virginia settled the state's opioid claims against J&J. Florida and West Virginia are currently in the midst of opioid trials against other defendants.

Unionized workers who make Oreos, Chips Ahoy!, Newtons and other Nabisco snacks are on strike in five states over what they say are unfair demands for concessions in contract negotiations. Members of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union in Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Oregon and Virginia have rejected managementâ€™s call for changes in shift lengths and overtime rules. The workers are also calling for the restoration of a pension plan, which Nabiscoâ€™s owner, Mondelez International, replaced in 2018 with a 401(k) program after a contract impasse. â€œWe want our pension back. We earned that,â€?Mike Burlingham, vice president of Local 364 in Portland, Ore., said in an interview. â€œThis is a good job, where people plan for retirement. If the company could have their way, that would be gone and it wouldnâ€™t be a job worth fighting for at all.â€?The union put the number of striking workers at more than 1,000. The previous contract expired in May. Union workers say they have often put in 16-hour days as demand for snack foods has increased during the pandemic. The company is seeking schedules in which some employees would have shifts of up to 12 hours without overtime pay but would work fewer days a week. Those on weekend shifts, previously eligible for extra pay, would get the premium only after working 40 hours in a week. In addition, new hires would pay more than other employees for health insurance. â€œOur goal has been â€?and continues to be â€?to bargain in good faith,â€?Mondelez International said in a statement, â€œwhile also taking steps to modernize some contract aspects which were written several decades ago.â€?The strike began in Portland on Aug. 10, and workers in Aurora, Colo.; Richmond, Va.; Chicago; and Norcross, Ga., followed suit, the most recent on Monday. The company said production was continuing with employees not under union jurisdiction. Union members say they have been treated unfairly while Mondelez International has made strong financial gains amid the pandemic. The company reported a 12 percent gain in revenue for the three months ending in June compared with the previous year. The workers have also called for the company to â€œstop exporting our jobs to Mexico.â€?Some Oreo production was shifted to Mexico in 2016, a move that was criticized by Donald J. Trump as a presidential candidate. This year, Nabisco plants were shut in Fair Lawn, N.J., and Atlanta, but Mondelez said no work there was sent to Mexico.

He will succeed Nicholas Gangestad, who plans to retire after six years as 3M's finance chief and 35 years with the company, 3M said.
""The company has undertaken two sizable restructurings over the past year while taking actions to aggressively lower costs temporarily in response to  that has negatively pressured a host of 3M businesses,"" John Inch, a senior analyst at research firm Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, said in a note to clients.
3M is expected to recoup some of the lost revenue in later quarters as lockdown orders and other restrictions are being phased out and consumers return to offices, shopping malls and health-care providers, said Nigel Coe, a managing director at Wolfe Research LLC, a research company.
The company came under fire from President Trump earlier this year for not bringing enough face masks into the U.S. The Trump administration and 3M agreed to import masks from the company's China operations, using the Defense Production Act. The company also is boosting its mask production in the U.S. and globally to meet more orders from health-care workers.
At GE, Mr. Patolawala was credited with turning around the company's struggling health-care business since he took over the finance department in 2015, said Joshua Aguilar, an equity analyst at investment research firm Morningstar Research Services LLC.
Even though it is unclear how much 3M will have to spend to resolve the matter, PFAS could be a huge financial liability for the company, said Deane Dray, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank.","Industrial conglomerate 3M Co. hired an external candidate for its top finance job as the manufacturer looks to offset the business impact of the coronavirus pandemic. St. Paul, Minn.-based 3Mâ€”which makes N95 face masks, Post-it Notes and other productsâ€”named Monish Patolawala to become its next chief financial officer, effective July 1. Mr. Patolawala is currently CFO of General Electric Co.'s health-care unit. He will succeed Nicholas Gangestad, who plans to retire after six years as 3M's finance chief and 35 years with the company, 3M said. In the wake of the spread of the novel coronavirus, 3M has seen strong demand for products such as masks but suffered declines in other areas, as lockdowns have resulted in lower industrial orders and a drop in health-care spending. With many offices across the U.S. still closed, there is less corporate purchasing of 3M's office supplies. The company has also seen big declines in products that are sold to dentists and car manufacturers. Mr. Patolawala will have to manage the financial impact of these trends on the company's balance sheet as well as other underlying challenges, analysts said. The company said its April sales declined 11% year-over-year. 3M has been under financial pressure since the beginning of 2019 amid slowing global growth and declining demand in core industries. The company missed or lowered its financial targets several times over the past two years and withdrew its annual guidance at the end of April. ""The company has undertaken two sizable restructurings over the past year while taking actions to aggressively lower costs temporarily in response to  that has negatively pressured a host of 3M businesses,"" John Inch, a senior analyst at research firm Gordon Haskett Research Advisors, said in a note to clients. 3M is expected to recoup some of the lost revenue in later quarters as lockdown orders and other restrictions are being phased out and consumers return to offices, shopping malls and health-care providers, said Nigel Coe, a managing director at Wolfe Research LLC, a research company. But a weaker outlook for the U.S. economy also clouds the outlook for 3M, Mr. Coe said. ""They cannot decouple themselves from the market,"" he said. The company in April said it plans to reduce expenses by up to $400 million in the second quarter, following earlier cost reductions. 3M said it was cutting its capital investments this year to about $1.3 billion, down from as much as $1.8 billion planned previously. It also faces challenges arising from tariff disputes between the U.S. and other major trading partners, including China, where 3M generates a portion of its revenue. The company came under fire from President Trump earlier this year for not bringing enough face masks into the U.S. The Trump administration and 3M agreed to import masks from the company's China operations, using the Defense Production Act. The company also is boosting its mask production in the U.S. and globally to meet more orders from health-care workers. Mr. Patolawala is expected to take additional steps to adjust 3M's cost base and improve its working capital position, analysts said. He could also play a role in the integration of Acelity Inc., a wound-care company that 3M bought in 2019. At GE, Mr. Patolawala was credited with turning around the company's struggling health-care business since he took over the finance department in 2015, said Joshua Aguilar, an equity analyst at investment research firm Morningstar Research Services LLC. As vice president of operational transformationâ€”a role Mr. Patolawala held alongside his most recent CFO-positionâ€”he played an important role in the restructuring of GE under Chief Executive Larry Culp, 3M said in its release. Mr. Patolawala, who joined GE in 1994 and qualified as a chartered accountant, declined to comment. 3M declined to make him available for an interview. Mr. Patolawala also is set to inherit a longstanding legal issue arising from the company's former production of chemicals known as perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Those chemicals were once used in Teflon cookware and other products and have been linked to cancer and other health problems. Even though it is unclear how much 3M will have to spend to resolve the matter, PFAS could be a huge financial liability for the company, said Deane Dray, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets, an investment bank.

3M,MMM,2020/7/12,local pollution,"N95 Face Mask Makers Ramp Production Meet U.S. Covid-19 Demand; American companies 3M, Honeywell Prestige Ameritech investing domestic production masks
The Covid-19 pandemic has unraveled the global supply chain for medical masks as manufacturers like 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. work in record time to stoke production at home.
Now, American companies like 3M, Honeywell and Prestige Ameritech Ltd. are investing in expansions to produce more masks in the U.S. in response to requests from hospitals and governments seeking a guaranteed domestic supplyfor several years.
The reinvented supply chain means that producers of the machines and materials required to assemble N95 masks, which are designed to block out 95% of very small particles, are ramping up U.S. production too.
The added capacity won't exceed domestic N95 demand until this winter, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, when the U.S. will be producing 180 million N95 masks a month, up from around 45 million in January.
Honeywell is adding a line in Scotland after the U.K. agreed to buy 70 million masks over 18 months, in addition to two new N95 facilities in the U.S. The Canadian government signed a 10-year supply agreement with Medicom Group, which is building a new mask factory there.
3M doubled its U.S. mask-making capacity earlier this year, but soon realized it would have to go much further.

3M has invested over $80 million to ramp up N95 mask production since the pandemic began.","The Covid-19 pandemic has unraveled the global supply chain for medical masks as manufacturers like 3M Co. and Honeywell International Inc. work in record time to stoke production at home. Before coronavirus, medical masks were largely made abroad, particularly in China. When infections grew globally earlier this year, countries and health systems found themselves competing for vital protective equipment and unable to meet demand. Now, American companies like 3M, Honeywell and Prestige Ameritech Ltd. are investing in expansions to produce more masks in the U.S. in response to requests from hospitals and governments seeking a guaranteed domestic supplyfor several years. The reinvented supply chain means that producers of the machines and materials required to assemble N95 masks, which are designed to block out 95% of very small particles, are ramping up U.S. production too. The added capacity won't exceed domestic N95 demand until this winter, the Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates, when the U.S. will be producing 180 million N95 masks a month, up from around 45 million in January. For now, shortages remain. Some hospitals and nursing homes are asking workers to use their N95 masks for entire shifts, or even a week, as they manage limited supplies. ""The pandemic has exposed fault lines across the industry,"" said Michael Vale, head of 3M's largest segment, which includes masks. ""There is going to be a broad-based rethinking."" Governments around the world are also bolstering their own domestic supply lines in response to a pandemic that has killed 580,000 and interrupted global travel and trade. Honeywell is adding a line in Scotland after the U.K. agreed to buy 70 million masks over 18 months, in addition to two new N95 facilities in the U.S. The Canadian government signed a 10-year supply agreement with Medicom Group, which is building a new mask factory there. Current plans would boost U.S. production of the main filtering component in N95s to about 90% of pre-virus U.S. demand, up from around 30% before the pandemic, according to Brad Kalil, director of market intelligence for INDA, an industry association. ""The world over is now looking at technologies that are critical to their security or national health and well-being in a very different way than we did not that many months ago,"" said Sara Greenstein, chief executive of Lydall Inc., which recently received $13.5 million in federal funding to expand its location that produces filters for masks.

(June 1) * Warnings Surface About New System to Disinfect N95 Masks (June 1) The Trump administration and some executives are working to bolster domestic production of other goods, including semiconductors and some drugs. They worry that the U.S. could be at a disadvantage if supply chains rely solely on production abroad. ""The U.S. is waking up to this problem,"" said Mike Bowen, an owner of Prestige Ameritech, a Texas mask company. A group of hospitals recently took a stake in the firm. ""We are going to make sure we are in an even better position in the next pandemic."" While the last major global pandemic hit the U.S. a century ago, the current crisis is likely to continue for some time, and experts predict more frequent pandemics in the future. Protective-gear makers note that more localized outbreaks have occurred regularly, noting recent swine flu, ebola and SARS events. To build a supply chain, companies need to prepare new facilities, assemble machines and establish supplier networksâ€”a process that can take years. 3M doubled its U.S. mask-making capacity earlier this year, but soon realized it would have to go much further. Americans used 140 million N95 masks in the 90 days through the end of May, according to government estimates. That is nearly triple the number typically used in an entire year and well above the capacity of domestic suppliers. 3M, already the biggest producer of N95 masks in the U.S., is becoming even larger. Pre-pandemic, 90% of its N95s went to industrial uses, but that ratio has flipped as the masks have proven key to protect essential workers. 3M said it has delivered nearly 100 million N95 respirators to hospitals in the U.S. and more than 100 million to FEMA and the U.S. stockpile. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you been able to easily find masks in your area during the pandemic? Join the conversation below. The company is going further. It came up with a plan to overcome bottlenecks in its U.S. supply chain and more than double its capacity again. It sought assurance from the government that it would have a buyer for many of those extra masks. It struck a deal with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and in May the Department of Defense awarded 3M $200 million to convert a facility where mask-fabricating machines are made into a temporary mask factory. Automated mask-making machines are set to be shaping filtering materials, attaching nose pieces and stamping on 3M's logos more than 2,000 times a minute in the U.S. by October, given the company's goal of 95 million a month. Normally, machine-producer Curt G. Joa Inc. assembles mask machines at its plant in Sheboygan Falls, Wis. for quality checks then breaks them down again for shipping to customers' factories. 3M is now temporarily operating mask-making machines built by Joa at a building across the corporate golf course from Joa's main facility, 600 miles east of 3M's main mask plant in Aberdeen, S.D. 3M says the move will help it meet production goals more quickly. ""Speed matters,"" said Joa's president, Rick Michaletz. 3M will eventually move the machines to Aberdeen, where jets were a frequent presence on the local airstrip this spring as the company dispatched masks to early hot spots like New York. 3M said it expects to add about 100 employees in Aberdeen when the expansion is complete. Payoff isn't assured, though, for 3M and other mask makers. 3M has invested over $80 million to ramp up N95 mask production since the pandemic began. How long demand for N95 masks will remain elevated, or how much stockpiling officials and hospitals will do thereafter, is unknowable. ""It will be up, the question is for how much and how long,"" Joa's Mr. Michaletz said.

""We strongly support all initiatives aiming to increase vaccination rates especially at the workplace,"" Qiagen told Reuters in an email. Qiagen said it had already updated its policies to make vaccination compulsory for certain employee groups at its U.S. locations. 3M, the diversified manufacturer which makes everything from Post-It notes and adhesives to industrial sandpaper, said it will comply with the mandate while also adding that it was strongly encouraging its employees to get vaccinated. U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced policies requiring most federal employees to get COVID-19 vaccinations and pushing large and small private employers to have their workers inoculated or tested weekly. The White House said it will spend nearly $2 billion on 280 million rapid COVID-19 tests to support the drive. Abbott Laboratories, one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of rapid COVID-19 tests, said it was quickly working to scale up manufacturing of its two tests - BinaxNOW and ID NOW test kits - including hiring additional employees. Increased capacity will ensure availability of tens of millions more tests in the coming weeks and months, the medical device maker said. The new vaccination mandate could apply to as many as 100 million Americans - close to two-thirds of the country's workforce - and amount to Biden's strongest push yet for inoculation. Southwest Airlines Co, which has more than 54,000 employees, said it was prepared to move toward compliance with the mandate. ""We continue to strongly encourage our Employees to seek and obtain vaccination, and to share their vaccination status with us,"" the company said.

The reform underpins the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that took effect two years ago. The law is meant to resolve labor disputes more swiftly and to help Mexican workers achieve better pay after years of stagnant salaries. ""The amount of work that needs to be done is tremendous,"" U.S. Deputy Secretary of Labor Julie Su told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday in the central city of San Luis Potosi, one of Mexico's top automaking hubs. On her first international trip in her role, Su met with workers, business leaders and local government officials. ""There's a broad recognition that this is going to require resources to do right,"" she said. The labor reform was signed into law in 2019. All of Mexico's 31 states as well as the federal capital Mexico City were scheduled to implement changes to their labor justice systems by May 2022. However, Mexico's Labor Ministry requested a five-month extension for the last dozen states due to budget and scheduling limitations. Still, Su said Mexican officials had made ""good progress,"" citing the creation of a federal agency meant to process worker disputes quickly and to oversee votes to ratify union contracts. She also noted that officials at both the local and federal levels had ramped up hiring and training, and planned to do more. ""We are ... watching to see that the rest of the commitments also come through,"" she said. Su also called on U.S. companies to model good behavior in Mexico. General Motors faced scrutiny under USMCA mechanisms last year for worker rights violations, as did U.S. company Cardone over allegations of abuses at its auto parts plant Tridonex. Both companies said they were committed to respecting worker rights. ""We hope there will be leadership also from American companies to support the USMCA commitments and to help create a culture in which there is broader recognition that what's good for workers is good for business,"" Su said. Several workers from the San Luis Potosi plant of industrial giant 3M Co, in a meeting with Su, asked her team to keep monitoring U.S. companies in Mexico, especially as a group of 3M workers begin the task of forming an independent union. ""We recognize the importance of keeping an eye on making sure the promises in the laws, the promises in the USMCA ... are actually realized,"" Su replied. 3M said it is committed to providing a safe work environment with competitive salaries and respects the right of workers to organize.

And that isn't good for U.S. companies that do a lot of business in the country, including 3M, Tesla, and many other manufacturers. China had anindustrial production growth for July of 3.8% year over year, while economists had projected 4.3%. Industrial production growth is 3.5% this year, compared with 2021. Through July of last year, industrial production was 14.4% higher than the comparable period in 2020. July retail sales came in up 2.7% year over year, again missing estimates. Economists projected growth of 4.9%. Retail sales in China are down this year, compared with 2021. The retail-sales statistic is potentially problematic for auto makers including Tesla (ticker: TSLA) and General Motors (GM). Tesla generated roughly 26% of its sales from China in 2021. GM generated about 11%. Tesla is over-indexed to China, compared with other U.S. auto makers, because China is the world's largest market for EVs.

The stocks impacted by China listed are down an average of about 0.7% in midday trading Monday. The S&P 500 is off 0.2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 0.2%. Illinois Tool Works stock is the weakest, down about 1.5%, wounded by a downgrade. Deutsche Bank analyst Nicole Deblase lowered her rating on the shares to Sell from Hold Monday, but kept a below-market $188 price target. Illinois Tool Works shares are trading at around $214 Monday afternoon. China didn't weigh heavily in the downgrade decision. Deblase thinks Illinois Tool Works stock is too expensive relative to the group. She is also worried more about exposure to Europe. Illinois Tool Works generates about 27% of its sales in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The median exposure to Europe in Deblase's coverage list is about 21%. For China, the median exposure for industrial companies that do business outside of the U.S. is about 10%. There are, of course, many large industrials that don't do business overseas. Union Pacific (UNP), for instance, has a market capitalization of almost $150 billion. That's more than double ITW's cap. Union Pacific generates all of its sales in North America. Of the group impacted by China, only Tesla stock is up. Investors must be thinking about a coming stock split or EV tax credits. The stock-market reaction to the data coming out of China Monday is, frankly, a little confusing. Along with the economic numbers, Chinese EV maker Li Auto (LI) provided delivery guidance for the third quarter well below Wall Street estimates. The company now plans to ship roughly 28,000 vehicles in the third quarter. Analysts had expected closer to 39,000 vehicles. Li American depositary receipts fell about 8% to start the day. Now ADRs are up about 2%. Investors seem to be interpreting Li's guidance as an issue related to ramping up sales of its new SUV, the L9, which may be stealing sales from the company's first product, the Li ONE. Investors seemed relieved by that explanation for weak guidance. Investors would be more relieved if the Chinese economy accelerates in the second half of 2022.

The Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Wednesday granted Aearo's petition requesting a direct review of the bankruptcy-court ruling, bypassing a federal-district court and putting the appeal on a faster track to resolution. The appeal stems from an August ruling by Judge Jeffrey Graham of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Indianapolis, who declined to shield 3M from continued litigation involving military earplugs and extending to it the litigation stay that Aearo received automatically by filing for chapter 11. The bankruptcy ruling has allowed 230,000 personal-injury claims against 3M, which didn't seek chapter 11 protection itself, to continue proceeding on behalf of U.S. military veterans who allege the earplugs didn't work as promised and left them with lasting hearing damage. The claimants blame faulty earplug design for their alleged injuries, while 3M says the earplugs are safe when used properly. 3M has argued that chapter 11 provides all claimants with an equitable resolution, and pays them more quickly and efficiently than the tort system. Personal-injury lawyers have fought to keep the earplug lawsuits out of bankruptcy court and accused 3M of misusing chapter 11 to escape mass lawsuits it was losing. ""The well-established chapter 11 process provides a more efficient, equitable and expeditious means to resolve this litigation,"" a 3M spokesman said. Bryan Aylstock and Christopher Seeger, tort lawyers representing earplug claimants, said the appeal is without merit and that the Seventh Circuit should uphold Judge Graham's decision. The Seventh Circuit's move comes after another appeals court in Philadelphia took up a direct review of Johnson & Johnson's use of chapter 11 to shift mass litigation to bankruptcy court. The Third Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals is expected to rule in the coming months on whether J&J deserves protection from injury lawsuits based on the chapter 11 filing of a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC. On Wednesday, 3M also earned a stay from the Eleventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on a different August ruling from a federal court in Florida barring 3M from using Aearo's bankruptcy case to relitigate issues it already lost in the earplug lawsuits. 3M has said the decision by Judge M. Casey Rodgers of the U.S. District Court in Pensacola, Fla., would hinder efforts to negotiate a global settlement in bankruptcy court.

""We are pleased with this decision and have said all along that our minority investment in Juul does not harm competition and does not violate the antitrust laws,"" said Murray Garnick, Altria's general counsel.

The Federal Trade Commission sued two years ago to unwind the deal, saying the Marlboro maker had violated antitrust laws. Chief Administrative Law Judge D. Michael Chappell, who presided over a three-week trial last summer, dismissed the FTC's claims Tuesday, Altria said. The ruling is a preliminary decision. It could be appealed by the FTC. The FTC's commissioners next must vote on the matter. An FTC spokeswoman said she couldn't comment until the decision has been released publicly. ""We are pleased with this decision and have said all along that our minority investment in Juul does not harm competition and does not violate the antitrust laws,"" said Murray Garnick, Altria's general counsel. Juul declined to comment. Altria, the biggest U.S. cigarette company, bought a 35% stake in Juul for $12.8 billion in December 2018. It made the move after shutting down its own e-cigarette business. A key question at trial was why Altria ended production of its own e-cigarettes shortly before announcing its investment in Juul. The FTC alleged Altria did so because of an illegal side deal in which it agreed to close its own e-cigarette business so it could take a stake in Juul. Altria and Juul both denied they had any such agreement. In trial testimony, Altria executives said the company had thrown hundreds of millions of dollars at developing a successful e-cigarette, yet failed to come up with anything smokers liked. At the time of the investment, Juul's sales were growing rapidly and threatening Altria's core cigarette business. Juul's sales then tumbled after it pulled back on its marketing and halted sales of its fruity flavors, amid regulatory scrutiny and pressure to address a surge in underage vaping. Altria has since slashed the value of its Juul investment, estimating its worth at $1.7 billion as of Dec. 31.

While health officials encourage those whoâ€™ve gotten the double-dose Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna series to get a third shot, J&J recipients are limited to their original one and a single booster.
Of the 16.3 million people who got the J&J vaccine as their first dose, about 3.5 million have gotten boosted, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Thatâ€™s in part because so few J&J doses have been given compared with the 190 million who've been fully vaccinated with a two-dose series of either Pfizer or Moderna.
â€œThe mRNA vaccines went into widespread use at least three months earlier and established a far larger market share,â€?Moore said, adding that U.S. regulators must make decisions based on evidence that takes time to gather and not assumptions.
In a call with reporters Monday, he said there was strong evidence an adenovirus vector vaccine, such as J&J's, followed by an mRNA vaccine produced a very good immune response.
The wait isnâ€™t easy, especially when public health messaging is focused on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, said Jill Oliver, 57, of Boulder, Colorado.

Thatâ€™s the number of Americans who got the one-shot vaccine as their first COVID-19 dose and now find themselves in a gray zone. While health officials encourage those whoâ€™ve gotten the double-dose Pfizer -BioNTech or Moderna series to get a third shot, J&J recipients are limited to their original one and a single booster. Of the 16.3 million people who got the J&J vaccine as their first dose, about 3.5 million have gotten boosted, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . But they canâ€™t go beyond that. â€œI suspect there are thousands of J&J recipients in my situation who are questioning our protection,"" said Donna Alston, 61, of Philadelphia. â€œI went to my pharmacy last week to see if I could sign up and they said no. Barring additional guidance from the CDC, Iâ€™m prohibited from getting additional vaccine.â€?STAY CONNECTED: Subscribe to Coronavirus Watch, your free daily update on all things COVID-19 in the USA The J&J vaccine was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration on Feb. 27. It wasnâ€™t until Oct. 20 the agency allowed a booster dose of the vaccine for adults age 18 and older at least two months after their initial dose. No third dose has been authorized. Thatâ€™s in part because so few J&J doses have been given compared with the 190 million who've been fully vaccinated with a two-dose series of either Pfizer or Moderna. That's a big data gap, said Dr. Kelly Moore, chief executive officer of Immunize.org, which educates health care professionals about U.S. vaccine recommendations. â€œThe mRNA vaccines went into widespread use at least three months earlier and established a far larger market share,â€?Moore said, adding that U.S. regulators must make decisions based on evidence that takes time to gather and not assumptions. The FDA is collecting that data now, said Dr. Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. In a call with reporters Monday, he said there was strong evidence an adenovirus vector vaccine, such as J&J's, followed by an mRNA vaccine produced a very good immune response. Now, the agency is looking at how well that response lasts. He expects information to be coming within weeks to months. â€œAs we get those data, we'll analyze them and then potentially make recommendations,â€?Marks said. The wait isnâ€™t easy, especially when public health messaging is focused on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, said Jill Oliver, 57, of Boulder, Colorado. THE LATEST GUIDANCE: What to do if you test positive for COVID-19 or are exposed â€œThey keep saying, â€˜Three doses, three doses.â€?Well, please finish that sentence and say, â€˜If youâ€™ve had J&J and are boosted, youâ€™re set,'â€?she said. Oliver got her J&J shot in July. She didnâ€™t choose; it was what was on offer. â€œAll the doctors were saying, â€˜The best vaccine is the one in your arm.â€?So when it was my turn, I took it,â€?she said. Oliver followed the public health advice again, getting her booster â€?Moderna â€?on Halloween, less than two weeks after they were authorized. â€œI thought I was good,â€?she said. Until, that is, data began to show the vaccine's protection could fade over time. Then came the ultra-infectious omicron variant, and suddenly two shots just didnâ€™t seem like enough. Now, sheâ€™d like another boost. Coverage from the J&J vaccine does wane over time, acknowledged Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center . But the protection it offers against severe illness and death remains high, he said. â€œI can understand some of those people feeling a little forlorn and at a deficit because of all the discussion about three shots,â€?he said. â€œI would just comfort them and let them know that J&J followed by one of the mRNA s gets a huge antibody response.â€?In Denver, Emily Moore, 50, got a dose of Pfizer vaccine as a booster to her original J&J. A diabetic, she'd really like a third now, but has been turned away from her pharmacy, which is waiting on further booster guidance. â€œIâ€™ve been honest,"" she said. ""I havenâ€™t tried doing it sneakily, or lying and saying I lost my card."" Even for those willing to skirt the truth, it appears harder to sneak extra doses than it once was. In Boulder, Oliver said she had several friends who got J&J as their first shot and then went in to get a second shot without mentioning their first. COVID VACCINE COCKTAILS: A guide to mixing and matching Pfizer , Moderna, J&J booster shots No more. â€œOur county has put the kibosh on that,"" she said. ""They started checking peopleâ€™s cards and their system, so even though a lot of people did it early on, you canâ€™t now.â€?For now, itâ€™s a waiting game for J&J recipients hoping for another immune system boost. In Richmond, Virginia, Kevin Rosengren is on board with following the data. He got his first dose in late March and a booster in late October. He sympathizes with the regulators doing science in real-time. â€œWeâ€™re getting information fast and furious; itâ€™s a tough call,â€?he said. Even so, Rosengren would like to get a third dose of vaccine as omicron sends cases to record levels in the U.S. â€œIf you just wanted to strap a bag of vaccine to me so it was constantly dripping into my body, Iâ€™d be fine with that,â€?he said.

* This week Goldman Sachs' largest ever tech conference is happening in San Francisco.
* Tech executives from Microsoft, Qualcomm and Western Digital among others shared dour outlooks.
A ""rather abrupt deceleration of demand"" Chuck Whitten, co-COO of Dell, one of the largest PC and server makers, shared a similar confounding mix of caution and quiet confidence during a Monday afternoon conference presentation.
Dell's CSG business, which sells laptops and other PC gear to consumers and companies, saw a ""rather abrupt deceleration of demand"" in the fiscal second quarter, Whitten said.
The world is not meeting the demand of cloud customers right now, Whitten said.
Earlier in the day, Marvell executives were similarly confident about demand for their chips from cloud companies.
Judson Althoff, an EVP and Chief Commercial Officer at Microsoft, said the economic environment is ""arguably the most uncertain we've seen in decades."" Executives from Western Digital, which makes data storage components including NAND flash memory and DRAM chips, described a ""very difficult environment,"" during their conference talk.
""The NAND industry is contracting at a rate that we've not seen in a very long time,"" Western Digital CEO David Goeckeler said.","* This week Goldman Sachs' largest ever tech conference is happening in San Francisco. * Tech executives from Microsoft, Qualcomm and Western Digital among others shared dour outlooks. * Chipmakers feel the early signs of weakened consumer demand, which could last well into the next two quarters. At the end of the first day of the Goldman Sachs Communacopia + Technology Conference, I met one of my oldest and best sources at the bar of the Palace Hotel in San Francisco. ""It's been a shitty year,"" the veteran tech investor said, sipping an Old Fashioned. The stock market is down, and tech stocks have been walloped, especially the long-duration, growth companies he likes to back. The IPO market is dormant and probably won't recover until well into 2023, while tech M&A will be difficult, the investor added. Early on Monday, news broke that Goldman is cutting hundreds of jobs, lending an extra soupcon of gloom. And yet, the conference was heaving with attendees and one Goldman banker noted this was the busiest version of the event ever. While many tech executives shared dour outlooks, no one was freaking out and some were cautiously optimistic about 2023. These companies, especially chipmakers and their customers, are one of the best economic indicators to watch. Chips are in everything now, so when demand wanes, these businesses are among the first to feel it. This is the message they shared this week: Welcome to the weirdest economic slowdown in recent memory. Interest rates are rising and inflation is staying stubbornly high, so people are expecting more pain to come. But the tech industry churns onward, with some enduring pockets of strength. ""Everyone is waiting for the wheels to come off but they are still turning,"" this investor said, citing Tesla and Amazon as examples. This person asked not to be identified so they could speak freely. A ""rather abrupt deceleration of demand"" Chuck Whitten, co-COO of Dell, one of the largest PC and server makers, shared a similar confounding mix of caution and quiet confidence during a Monday afternoon conference presentation. Dell's CSG business, which sells laptops and other PC gear to consumers and companies, saw a ""rather abrupt deceleration of demand"" in the fiscal second quarter, Whitten said. Commercial customers are being more cautious about hiring, so need fewer new computers. On the consumer side, Dell expected the quarter to be challenging, but the deceleration was quicker than expected, he added. Larger enterprises have slowed more than small and medium-sized firms, which is the opposite of what usually happens during an economic downturn. ""What do we make of that? We're not quite sure,"" Whitten said while noting that applying strategies from prior recessions may not work because the current economic situation is so different. Dell's ISG division, which sells servers and data storage to big cloud companies and other corporate customers, is performing relatively better than the CSG unit. Dell feels very good about the backlog of its server orders, and it's seen no increases in order cancellations. The world is not meeting the demand of cloud customers right now, Whitten said. Earlier in the day, Marvell executives were similarly confident about demand for their chips from cloud companies. A ""very difficult environment"" Other tech companies were less sanguine. Judson Althoff, an EVP and Chief Commercial Officer at Microsoft, said the economic environment is ""arguably the most uncertain we've seen in decades."" Executives from Western Digital, which makes data storage components including NAND flash memory and DRAM chips, described a ""very difficult environment,"" during their conference talk. ""The NAND industry is contracting at a rate that we've not seen in a very long time,"" Western Digital CEO David Goeckeler said. Pricing is deteriorating and the company will likely delay the start of its next factory, the executives added. An employee from rival SK Hynix, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said he was not surprised by the dour comments from Western Digital executives. The NAND market is worse than the DRAM market right now, he explained. In the DRAM industry, there are only three main players now, so there's more bargaining power and the bottom-cycle profit margins are higher than in NAND, where there are five players and more competition, he added. Cristiano Amon, CEO of wireless chipmaker Qualcomm, noted weaker consumer demand, especially toward the low-end of the smartphone mass-market. ""We kind of expect that weakness to propagate over the next 2 quarters,"" he added. ""In 2023 at some point we get back to normal, but we see weakness with anything related to the consumer.""

Bulky watches, bright wristbands and Roman-gladiator-meets-the-Jetsons arm straps have been the go-to look for manufacturers like Nike and Jawbone. But these wearable gadgets â€?often a dull representation of function over form â€?are finally getting a fashion-industry makeover. Fitbit, the maker of the Fitbit One and Flex, has teamed with the designer Tory Burch to make new trackers that look like stylish jewelry. In January, Intel started a wearable design competition that will award a total of $1.25 million in prize money. (Intel also signaled its seriousness about wearable tech this week by purchasing the fitness tracker company Basis for a reported $100 million, so look for new design ideas in future Basis products). And a handful of companies are already shipping wearable electronics that look less like athletic gear and more like well-chosen accessories. Iâ€™ve spent the last two weeks wearing the Shine tracker by Misfit Wearables. Itâ€™s a small, tough, aluminum disc that can be worn several ways. The standard kit includes the tracker (in black, blue, gold or silver), a magnetic clip for attaching it to clothing or shoes, and a black rubber athletic wristband. You can also buy accessories like a leather wristband and a necklace. You simply pop the magnetized disc into the various accessories to change the look. The Shine is highly water-resistant, so itâ€™s a good option for use while swimming. And it doesnâ€™t need to be charged because it runs on a coin cell battery for up to six months â€?you can change the battery when it runs out. Sonny Vu, Misfitâ€™s chief executive, said his team spent months researching wearable tech to figure out the right design and found a wide range of results. For example, he said, neither men nor women wanted to clip devices to their shoes when they werenâ€™t cycling or running because, Mr. Vu said, â€œyour shoes are the foundation of your fashion.â€?In another surprising discovery, he said that in one survey of 2,000 women, a large percentage said they wouldnâ€™t wear a wristband because it created tan lines. â€œIf we only think about the wrist, we will definitely be limiting our imagination,â€?Mr. Vu said. â€œYou can do a heck of a lot at the wrist, but you will be limiting the people who will use it. The body is such a sacred place that you really have to think this through.â€?But the wrist is where wearable gadgets first got noticed. Nikeâ€™s introduction of the Nike+ FuelBand in 2012 spurred a wrist-based gold rush that spread to smartwatches, an idea that has had varying degrees of nonsuccess since the 1980s. (See a review of the Pebble Steel smartwatch in this weekâ€™s Gadgetwise column.) The only other type of wearable device that has received much attention is glasses, like Googleâ€™s Glass project â€?an expensive, still unproved idea. For wearable-device makers, like it or not, the wrist has been the focus despite those tan lines. â€œThe wrist is a relatively safe place, itâ€™s functional and itâ€™s also unisex,â€?said Robert Brunner, an industrial designer who co-founded Ammunition, a San Francisco design studio best known for creating the Beats by Dr. Dre headphones. â€œMen or women will put something on their wrist, generally. Itâ€™s a place weâ€™re used to wearing technology.â€?Still, the earliest activity trackers werenâ€™t wristbands. They were clips that were meant to be worn on a waistband, or clipped to a sports bra or pocket. Fitbit released a clippable activity tracker as early as 2008. But when companies like Jawbone and Nike released wristbands like the Up and the FuelBand, Fitbit said its customers started to ask for bands, as well. The Fitbit Flex was introduced in 2013, although Fitbit still makes clips. Fitbit says that wristbands may be popular but theyâ€™re not necessarily as good at collecting data, because your wrists move in unpredictable ways that donâ€™t always produce accurate results. â€œThe wrist is good and bad,â€?said James Park, Fitbitâ€™s chief executive. â€œThe great thing is that once you put a band there or some other device, you have the option of not having to take it off and not forgetting it. But itâ€™s much more difficult to track things like motion, steps taken, calories burned â€?filtering that out is a lot tougher than it is on a clip.â€?And there are movements and exercises that simply wonâ€™t count if youâ€™re wearing a tracker on your wrist. You could burn 1,000 calories in spin class, but your FuelBand might never know it because your wrist stays stationary on the bike handles. Consumers are also asking for devices that can measure heart rate, which is difficult with a wristband. The Basis B1 band can do it, but most reviewers find it less accurate than chest strap monitors. Then, of course, thereâ€™s style. Many athletic wristbands are simply athletic-looking or flat-out ugly. Even beautiful ones like the Jawbone Up ultimately look inorganic. Accessory style is a personal and subjective thing, of course, but choice is key. The Shine comes closest to a wearable device that could be a permanent addition to my wardrobe, but itâ€™s definitely not the end of the experiment. Itâ€™s a bit expensive: $120 for the disc, clasp and wristband, and $50 each for the necklace and leather band. Neither of those are exactly high-fashion, but theyâ€™re a start. Also, with the Shine around my neck, I seemed to log far fewer motion points than on the wrist (that could just be my sedentary imagination). I also would have liked a few more software features, like the reward system that challenges you to work harder on the Nike+ app, and better social integration with Facebook or Twitter. I did like Shineâ€™s activity tracking, which lets you specify that youâ€™re swimming, cycling or playing other sports. That feature is supposed to help you get more accurate measurements. And I love the fact that it doesnâ€™t require charging. What the Shine does best, though, is serve as a reference design for future wearables. Thereâ€™s no need for them to be tied to the wrist, or to any single part of the body. The little sensors inside the devices are relatively simple and are the key to the next wave of wearable evolution. They will power devices that â€œare going to continue to grow on us, on the body, and around the body,â€?said the creator of the Jawbone Up, Yves BÃ©har. â€œIt isnâ€™t going to be a single object that does all of the functionality of your phone and all the medical and all the other functionalities that you need in your life,â€?Mr. BÃ©har said. â€œI think weâ€™re going to see a lot of diversity, a lot of unique designs, a lot of unique approaches to fashion, to materials. And people will pick and choose what fits them.â€?

But one of the first companies to crack the space may be pulling out. As first reported by CNET, when it comes to wearables, Nike may be saying, ""Just don't."" In a report Friday, the technology site said that the fitness firm has laid off a number of employees in the division responsible for its FuelBand, a wristband that the company first released in 2012 that allows users to track aspects of their fitness such as the number of steps they take. According to the CNET report, Nike has decided to focus its efforts on building software for fitness trackers rather than the hardware -- a move that could eventually spell the end of the FuelBand altogether. Nike did not respond to a request for comment, but told Re/Code that it is still planning to improve the company's FuelBand app and will sell and support the current version of the product, the Nike+FuelBandSE, for the ""foreseeable future."" But getting out of the wearable hardware game makes a lot of sense for Nike, which has all but perfected the process of manufacturing clothing but isn't exactly an expert in tech hardware. Building out its software gives Nike the opportunity to partner with an increasing number of companies that are said to be jumping into the hardware space. The most promising of those expected companies is, without a doubt, Apple. Apple chief executive Tim Cook is a member of Nike's board and a FuelBand user himself, having donned the gadget at the All Things D tech conference last year. At the same conference, Cook said that Apple has found the wrist to be an ""interesting"" place for wearables, setting off a wave of speculation that the company really is planning to build an ""iWatch."" A Nike-Apple partnership that builds on the one the firms already have -- Nike+ iPod is already a default service built into iOS devices -- would make a lot of sense for both companies if those rumored plans come to fruition. Rather than see this as a death knell for the wearables market, it may actually be a sign that the industry is growing up and moving beyond fitness. Fitness is arguably the most obvious application for wearables, but tech has a tendency to move away from single-use devices and onto gadgets that can do everything. We're already seeing that happening with early attempts at wearables, Samsung's line of smartwatches and Google Glass. Sure, these gadgets are still being met with skepticism, but that's mostly because they're still a little clunky. If Nike can get out of the hardware-design game and focus on making apps that make wearables worth wearing, it would be a smart move for it and for the tech industry.",,,,,

Donâ€™t â€˜Old.â€?â€œThere needs to be a shoe for the slower runner,â€?Mr. Knight says in the ad.
Itâ€™s a perfect example of what Rob Chess, a Stanford Graduate School of Business lecturer, calls â€œstealth designâ€? a product that addresses specific needs of older consumers in a form that doesnâ€™t scream, well, â€œold.â€?â€œYou basically put all these elements in that make it much more usable by an older customer, but you donâ€™t necessarily advertise and play up those elements,â€?Mr. Chess said.
â€œThe idea is to market not to a name and not to an age, but to the stage of life or vibrancy.â€?As of April, U.S. households headed by people 55 or older held $92.3 trillion, or 69 percent of the countryâ€™s total wealth, according to Lowell Ricketts, a data scientist at the Institute for Economic Equity at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
â€œWe also know that old people will run with their hair on fire away from it.â€?Dr. Coughlin said companies instead needed to position their products as being for â€œan ageless lifestyleâ€?that â€œkeeps people engaged and productive, healthy and well.â€?On one hand, this approach risks dressing up the same social stereotypes and pressures in new language, akin to the magazine covers exhorting readers to â€œget healthyâ€?rather than explicitly telling them to lose weight, or makeup ads promising skin that looks â€œrevitalizedâ€?without using the word â€œyounger.â€?On the other, focusing on consumersâ€?actual needs instead of their assumed age has the added benefit of appealing to all of a productâ€™s potential users.
An ad that acknowledges this bodily reality, rather than just showing an older model, she said, is â€œin some ways more revolutionary.â€?The CruzrOne, with its marketing campaignâ€™s focus on pace rather than age, is another such example.
In this new approach to marketing, age matters less than the lifestyle of the buyer, Dr. Golden said: â€œA 65-year-old and a 25-year-old could be as excited and engaged in life, or an 80-year-old could be running marathons.â€?This last part, at least, is something Nike has long acknowledged.","To reach a rapidly expanding demographic, companies are changing their tone. According to company lore, the idea for Nikeâ€™s CruzrOne sneaker â€?a well-cushioned, thick-soled running shoe that debuted in 2019 â€?originated with a conversation between a Nike designer, Tinker Hatfield, and the companyâ€™s co-founder Phil Knight. Mr. Hatfield made the mistake of congratulating Mr. Knight on his habit of walking eight miles a day and received a swift correction from his billionaire boss. â€œI was running,â€?Mr. Knight says dryly in a promotional video, bearing a slightly aggrieved expression. â€œJust running not very fast.â€?Nike makes shoes for sprinters and distance runners who cover all kinds of terrain. The conversation with Mr. Knight left Mr. Hatfield with an idea to design a shoe for a large, fast-growing and often overlooked market: runners who arenâ€™t in a hurry. â€œThere needs to be a shoe for the slower runner,â€?Mr. Knight says in the ad. â€œAnd thatâ€™s me.â€?What is not said explicitly in the video is that Mr. Knight is in his 80s. Age is never mentioned in any of the CruzrOneâ€™s marketing copy. By positioning the CruzrOne as a shoe with excellent support for runners who â€?for whatever reason â€?go at an extremely slow pace, Nike can offer a product designed for the older athlete to the general market. Itâ€™s a perfect example of what Rob Chess, a Stanford Graduate School of Business lecturer, calls â€œstealth designâ€? a product that addresses specific needs of older consumers in a form that doesnâ€™t scream, well, â€œold.â€?â€œYou basically put all these elements in that make it much more usable by an older customer, but you donâ€™t necessarily advertise and play up those elements,â€?Mr. Chess said. â€œOr if you do, you certainly donâ€™t position them as, you know, â€˜Gee, weâ€™re doing this for older people.â€™â€?(A Nike spokesperson declined requests for interviews.) Itâ€™s part of a seismic shift in the way companies market to consumers who have lived past their 55th birthday. The large and rapidly expanding demographic has enormous spending power, yet it has historically been treated as a homogeneous group that spends its days either in the louche leisure of a Viagra ad or the frail dependence of a Life Alert spot. In contrast, longevity experts said, todayâ€™s most effective marketing campaigns focus on the specific needs a product or service addresses, and the lifestyle of the person buying it â€?ideally without explicitly mentioning age at all. â€œI still see the word â€˜seniorâ€?and â€˜elderlyâ€?too often,â€?said Susan Golden, the director of dciX, a program of Stanfordâ€™s Distinguished Careers Institute for midlife professionals, and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. â€œThe idea is to market not to a name and not to an age, but to the stage of life or vibrancy.â€?As of April, U.S. households headed by people 55 or older held $92.3 trillion, or 69 percent of the countryâ€™s total wealth, according to Lowell Ricketts, a data scientist at the Institute for Economic Equity at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Older people today are wealthier than previous generations, and there are a lot more of them. By 2060, 95 million people in the United States will be 65 or older, up from 52 million in 2018, and constitute 23 percent of the population, up from 16 percent, according to the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit research group in Washington. â€œTheyâ€™re the biggest opportunity, and the fastest-growing opportunity,â€?Mr. Chess said. One reason so few products target older adults is a belief among many entrepreneurs that they are less willing to change brands or discover new products, said John Zapolski, founder and chief executive of Alive Ventures, a start-up studio that invests in brands focused on older people. Another is that a lot of people whose birth dates might qualify them for the demographic donâ€™t like to think of themselves as old, or donâ€™t recognize themselves in the version of old presented in a particular ad. A marketing campaign that positions a product for an aging consumer is unlikely to attract younger buyers, said Joseph Coughlin, founder and director of the AgeLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. â€œBut guess what?â€?he added. â€œWe also know that old people will run with their hair on fire away from it.â€?Dr. Coughlin said companies instead needed to position their products as being for â€œan ageless lifestyleâ€?that â€œkeeps people engaged and productive, healthy and well.â€?On one hand, this approach risks dressing up the same social stereotypes and pressures in new language, akin to the magazine covers exhorting readers to â€œget healthyâ€?rather than explicitly telling them to lose weight, or makeup ads promising skin that looks â€œrevitalizedâ€?without using the word â€œyounger.â€?On the other, focusing on consumersâ€?actual needs instead of their assumed age has the added benefit of appealing to all of a productâ€™s potential users. An example offered by Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a cultural critic and resident scholar at the Womenâ€™s Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, is the recent marketing campaign for the absorbent underwear Depend. â€œThis is an athlete, 20 reps deep,â€?an announcer intones in a 2020 ad as a middle-age woman works out outdoors, â€œand sprinting past every leak.â€?In another TV spot, a woman who does not appear old enough to collect Social Security leads a business meeting. Not all older people have use for absorbent underwear, but everyone with incontinence does: people who are pregnant or postpartum, who are taking certain medicines, who have bladder conditions or any number of temporary or recurring health issues. â€œIt was making absorbent underwear dignified and part of an ordinary life,â€?Dr. Gullette said. An ad that acknowledges this bodily reality, rather than just showing an older model, she said, is â€œin some ways more revolutionary.â€?The CruzrOne, with its marketing campaignâ€™s focus on pace rather than age, is another such example. Some older runners might prefer a shoe for a slower pace, but so might novice runners, or someone recovering from an injury. In this new approach to marketing, age matters less than the lifestyle of the buyer, Dr. Golden said: â€œA 65-year-old and a 25-year-old could be as excited and engaged in life, or an 80-year-old could be running marathons.â€?This last part, at least, is something Nike has long acknowledged. In the very first televised Nike ad featuring the famous â€œJust do itâ€?slogan, in 1988, the camera zooms in on the Golden Gate Bridge, where a bare-chested runner is making his daily 17-mile trek, Nike Airs on his feet, gray chest hair rippling in the morning breeze. â€œPeople ask me how I keep my teeth from chattering in the wintertime,â€?Walt Stack, then 80, explains to the camera. â€œI leave them in my locker.â€?

Michael Jordan first wore the Air Jordan 1 nearly four decades ago, an eternity in the fast-moving world of sneakers and fashion. On Saturday, Nike will re-release the shoe in its infamous Chicago Bulls colors. And even though Nike is releasing a reported 500,000 pairs, it will likely sell out in minutes. ""The Air Jordan 1 is the most iconic sneaker of all time,"" said Jordan Geller, a sneaker collector and former owner of the ShoeZeum who in 2020 sold a pair worn by Jordan for a record $560,000.

Shoe collectors, analysts, and industry watchers said the sneaker's rich backstory, Nike's ability to manage scarcity, recent blockbuster collaborations, and ""The Last Dance"" documentary have kept the sneaker atop the wishlist for sneakerheads. More than a third of trades since October 1 on Tradeblock, an app that lets collectors trade sneakers, have included a Jordan 1. The closets of Tradeblock members contain more than 250,000 pairs of Jordan 1s, according to the company. On eBay, sneaker collectors this year searched for Jordan 1s, on average, over 100,000 times a day, an 11% increase over 2021. The ""Lost and Found"" is already on track to also be one of the year's best-selling Jordan 1s on StockX, even though demand is softening for some non-original colors of the sneaker. The silhouette was ""essentially a lock to sell out in any colorway in 2019, 2020, and early 2021,"" said Dylan Dittrich, head of research at Altan Insights and author of the book ""Sneakonomic Growth,"" which tracks the growth of sneakers as an asset class. ""That's been less the case this year, as several releases no longer sell through with immediacy, and some secondary market prices reflect softness."" The Air Jordan 1 Chicago ""Lost and Found"" colorway will prove to be different. ""The demand for the Chicago colorway on a Jordan 1 will always remain for some because it's a true grail pair that surpasses all others,"" said TJ Keasal, a sneaker and sportswear digital creator. ""An instant hit"" While Michael Jordan's Nike deal is the gold standard for athlete endorsements, it didn't start that way. ""Initially, there were many more critics than there were enthusiasts of Nike's decision to give Michael Jordan a large sneaker deal before he played a single game in 1985,"" said Tradeblock cofounder and CEO Mbiyimoh ""Beems"" Ghogomu. As Jordan soared on NBA courts, his first signature shoe took off. Nike released the shoe nationally in March 1985. It sold $130 million of them in the first year. If the shoe and associated apparel had been a standalone company, it would have been the fifth-largest sneaker company in the world, the Washington Post reported in a sweeping story about Jordan's Nike deal in 1992. ""They were an instant hit,"" Geller said. ""One thing about the shoes that makes them so iconic is that they released in a variety of colors. Before the Air Jordan came out, most basketball shoes were very plain. They were usually white and black, white and navy, or white and gray."" The Jordan 1 also helped stop a rare Nike slump. In the mid-80s, Nike had whiffed on the aerobics boom and fallen behind Reebok. ""By the spring of 1984, things were going to hell,"" cofounder Phil Knight said in a 1993 Harvard Business School case study. By the late '80s, Nike had introduced an entire suite of Air products, including the Air Max, and the Jordan brand continued to grow. Between 1988 and 1991, Nike averaged a 36% annual sales increase. Nike also regained the industry lead from Reebok, a lead that it's never relinquished. ""Jordan's rise propelled the Air Jordan 1, resulting in nationwide demand and in making the shoes a must-have for sneakerheads,"" Ghogomu said. ""The silhouette blew up even more on the market when it went from being seen as a sneaker catered to basketball players to an everyday-wear sneaker once skaters got a hold of them."" It's since become a fashion staple, appearing on red carpets, the feet of NFL football players, musicians, and celebrities. When it's released in stores, long lines have formed outside of Foot Locker, Champs Sports, and boutiques with sneakerheads desperate to grab a pair. Scarcity, storytelling, collaborations and the ""Last Dance"" After 1985, The Air Jordan 1 didn't re-release in original specs until 1994. Nike would not retro the shoe again until 2015, although a near-original version released in 2013. ""All of those releases are coveted by sneaker collectors and the 'Lost and Found' Air Jordan 1 will be as well,"" Geller said. ""Nike has approached the Chicago colorway a little differently with far less retro releases, adding to the allure of owning a rare piece of sneaker history directly tied to the GOAT himself,"" Keasal added. ""Nike maintained demand two ways: scarcity and nostalgia."" While the shoe will sell out instantly, Wedbush Securities analyst Tom Nikic said the drop is ""less about what this launch does for the actual (profit and loss statement) of the company and more about what it means for the health of the brand."" Nike has continued to lean into the storytelling around the shoe. This year's version comes with a ""Lost and Found"" theme that harkens back to the early days of sneaker collecting, when prized shoes could be found in the dusty backrooms of sporting goods stores. The ""Lost and Found"" even comes in an aged-looking box with a handwritten receipt. In the past few years, Nike collaborated with some fashion and music icons on limited-edition versions of the Jordan 1, including Virgil Abloh and Travis Scott. Nike even released a ""Trophy Room"" version in 2021 in partnership with Marcus Jordan, one of Michael Jordan's sons and a sneaker boutique owner. Abloh's Off-White ""Chicago"" released in 2017. It last sold on StockX for $4,335. The final piece of the continued success of the Jordan 1 is the 2020 documentary ""The Last Dance,"" which introduced Jordan to a new wave of sneaker collectors. ""'The Last Dance' documentary comes into play for the current generation,"" Keasal said. ""Younger collectors or Air Jordan fans have never seen Jordan play live, but add in the perfect storm of this larger-than-life viewing experience with the world essentially reliving the greatest to play the game with an intimate look we'd never seen."" The boost from the ""Last Dance"" even got the attention of Nike CEO John Donahoe, who mentioned it on a June 2020 earnings call with stock analysts. ""The Jordan Brand resonated deeply in (the quarter) with the airing of ESPN's The Last Dance documentary,"" he said. ""The response we saw from the cultural conversation around each episode to the rapid sell-through of the AJ5 Fire Red demonstrated the love for the Jordan brand all over the world.""

SYDNEY, March 4 (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp is pushing for Australia to acquire Triton maritime surveillance drones earlier than planned, after a draft U.S. defence budget proposed a two-year pause in production, the firm said on Wednesday.
A spokesman for Australia's defence department said it was aware of the budget request to the U.S. Congress and was discussing the impact of the proposed pause with the U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman.
The proposed pause in U.S. production raises the risk that the U.S. Navy will not complete its order for 68 aircraft, leading to a higher cost for Australia with future improvement costs spread over a far smaller fleet, said defence analyst Marcus Hellyer.","SYDNEY, March 4 (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp is pushing for Australia to acquire Triton maritime surveillance drones earlier than planned, after a draft U.S. defence budget proposed a two-year pause in production, the firm said on Wednesday. Australia is the only foreign customer for the remotely piloted aircraft, after Germany scrapped a plan in January to buy the Triton drones. The proposed pause provides options for Australia to buy the drones cheaper, and hasten opportunities for local suppliers, if it helps to fill the production gap, said Doug Shaffer, the vice president of the firm's Triton programme. ""The price is a significant savings to Australia,"" he told reporters, but gave no further details. A spokesman for Australia's defence department said it was aware of the budget request to the U.S. Congress and was discussing the impact of the proposed pause with the U.S. Navy and Northrop Grumman. ""Until the legislation is approved, the pause on Triton funding is not confirmed,"" the spokesman added. Budget papers for fiscal 2021 that were released last month for the U.S. defense department include a two-year production pause for the U.S. Navy in FY2021 and FY2022. The drones would help boost monitoring activities by Australia, which has the world's third-largest exclusive economic zone after France and the United States, and the world's largest maritime search and rescue region, sprawling over a tenth of the earth's surface. In 2018, Australia announced plans to invest A$1.4 billion ($921.48 million) to acquire the first of six of the remotely piloted aircraft to step up its anti-submarine warfare and maritime strike capability, alongside its fleet of manned Boeing Co P-8A Poseidon planes. As part of its investment, Australia entered into a A$200 million cooperative program with the U.S. Navy to develop, produce and maintain the Triton aircraft. At the time, Australia said it expected the first aircraft to be introduced into service in mid-2023 and all six delivered by late 2025. The proposed pause in U.S. production raises the risk that the U.S. Navy will not complete its order for 68 aircraft, leading to a higher cost for Australia with future improvement costs spread over a far smaller fleet, said defence analyst Marcus Hellyer. ""The sunk cost fallacy suggests it could be better to cut our losses and get out now, even if we have spent hundreds of millions already,"" Hellyer, a senior analyst for defence economics and capability at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), said on its website. As yet, Australia has made no decision to defer any portions of the Triton programme, the defence spokesman said. ""There are no Australian Tritons currently in production, and no decision has been made by the Australian government to defer elements of the Triton programme,"" he added.

Nvidia,NVDA,2022/10/17,"anti competititve practices, violation of national legislation","Lam Adds Nvidia, Applied Materials Warnings Chip-Earnings Season; Falling demand U.S. restrictions semiconductor exports China pressure industry
U.S. curbs on exports of some of the most advanced chips to China unveiled less than two weeks ago have triggered a new round of profit warnings from semiconductor businesses and have prompted analysts to cut earnings forecasts for some of the companies designing chips and the tools to produce them.
Lam Research, a large U.S. chip-manufacturing equipment maker, said Wednesday that it expects to lose as much as $2.5 billion in sales next year from the China restrictions, although its outlook for around $5.1 billion in sales for its December quarter, which included the impact of restrictions, came in ahead of analyst forecasts.
Lam Chief Executive Tim Archer said a combination of the China curbs and deteriorating demand, especially in memory manufacturing, would push spending on chip-making equipment down by more than 20% next year.
Applied Materials Inc., one of the largest makers of chip-manufacturing equipment, earlier this month said that its sales for its current quarter should be around $400 million lower than it previously anticipated after the U.S. restrictions came out.
ASML Holding NV, the Dutch maker of some advanced chip-production tools that the U.S. has tried to keep out of China, on Wednesday said that it was assessing the effect of Washington's new regulations as it reported third-quarter sales of â‚?.8 billion, equivalent to about $5.7 billion, and record net bookings.
The graphics-chip specialist Nvidia Corp., the U.S.'s largest chip company by market value, also warned in August that it could take a quarterly sales hit of as much as $400 million after the U.S. government notified the company about limits on the sale of some of its products to China.
The U.S. rules on China require makers of manufacturing equipment to get licenses from the Commerce Department before selling to Chinese companies making advanced chips, among other strictures.","Chip-tool maker Lam Research Corp. warned of a potentially steep drop in sales as the U.S. imposes new restrictions on exports to China, highlighting how the global semiconductor industry's earnings woes have grown beyond a slump in demand for some consumer electronics. U.S. curbs on exports of some of the most advanced chips to China unveiled less than two weeks ago have triggered a new round of profit warnings from semiconductor businesses and have prompted analysts to cut earnings forecasts for some of the companies designing chips and the tools to produce them. Lam Research, a large U.S. chip-manufacturing equipment maker, said Wednesday that it expects to lose as much as $2.5 billion in sales next year from the China restrictions, although its outlook for around $5.1 billion in sales for its December quarter, which included the impact of restrictions, came in ahead of analyst forecasts. Lam Chief Executive Tim Archer said a combination of the China curbs and deteriorating demand, especially in memory manufacturing, would push spending on chip-making equipment down by more than 20% next year. Applied Materials Inc., one of the largest makers of chip-manufacturing equipment, earlier this month said that its sales for its current quarter should be around $400 million lower than it previously anticipated after the U.S. restrictions came out. Those expectations signal a significant potential hit to part of the chip-making industry where American companies dominate. ASML Holding NV, the Dutch maker of some advanced chip-production tools that the U.S. has tried to keep out of China, on Wednesday said that it was assessing the effect of Washington's new regulations as it reported third-quarter sales of â‚?.8 billion, equivalent to about $5.7 billion, and record net bookings. China accounts for around 17% of its sales. ASML said it expected limited direct impact because its tools don't use a lot of U.S. technology, though there could be an indirect effect on about 5% of the company's backlog. CEO Peter Wennink signaled, though, that there are other signs of potential disruptions. ""There is uncertainty in the market due to a number of global macroeconomic concerns including inflation, consumer confidence and the risk of a recession,"" he said, adding, however, that demand for ASML tools remained strong. The graphics-chip specialist Nvidia Corp., the U.S.'s largest chip company by market value, also warned in August that it could take a quarterly sales hit of as much as $400 million after the U.S. government notified the company about limits on the sale of some of its products to China. The U.S. rules on China require makers of manufacturing equipment to get licenses from the Commerce Department before selling to Chinese companies making advanced chips, among other strictures. The curbs on Nvidia affect some of the highest-performance chips the company makes, which are used to do artificial-intelligence calculations that the U.S. fears would be used for China's military, surveillance and nuclear-weapons programs. Beijing has criticized the restrictions. The U.S. government measures are serious, said Bank of America research analyst Vivek Arya, noting that China is the world's largest customer for semiconductors. He added that the bulk of the chips sent to China are for goods such as smartphones, PCs and videogames, not the supercomputer application some of the U.S. measures target. Analysts expect the rules to have a more significant impact on China's efforts to develop its domestic chip-making sector. Cowen Inc. said the restrictions could cut $10 billion from spending on chip manufacturing equipment next year alone. The regulatory threat to sales comes as consumer appetite for PCs has rapidly deteriorated. Buyers that gorged on devices when the pandemic first hit are holding off on buying new machines in the midst of recession fears and high inflation. Gartner Inc. says the recent downturn in PC shipments is the worst in more than two decades. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which makes central-processing units for PCs and competes with Intel Corp., this month cut its forecast for third-quarter sales by about $1.1 billion, citing flagging PC demand, muting expectations for its quarterly results expected Nov. 1. At Intel, PC-related chips account for about half of revenue, and its sales are forecast to fall by 15% when it reports third-quarter figures next week, according to a survey of analysts by FactSet. That follows a tumultuous second quarter for Intel, in which it reported a surprise loss and issued a glum outlook. Sales of smartphones, a major destination for chips, have been under pressure and are expected to be down 6.5% this year, according to International Data Corp. San Diego-based Qualcomm Inc., a supplier of chips for phones, in July cut its annual smartphone forecast and gave a more muted outlook for the quarter than Wall Street had expected. The company is still expected to report a rise in sales in its next results on Nov. 2, as its chips gain share in Samsung Electronics Co.'s latest phones and it expands its automotive and internet-of-things businesses. Market conditions have led to other signs that the global chip shortage is easing. The average time it takes for a chip maker to deliver an order of chips fell by four days in September, according to statistics from Susquehanna International Group, the largest decrease in any month since the shortage took hold. In a sign of investor sentiment, the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index has slid around 44% this year and 13% since the end of the second quarter alone. To adjust, some chip makers are cutting back on spending, including slowing the expansion of production capacity even as they remain committed to long-term growth. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology Inc. in September said it was reducing its capital spending by around 30% to $8 billion in its current fiscal year to limit oversupply as demand weakened. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the world's largest contract chip maker, trimmed its planned spending by about 10% this year in October, to $36 billion, citing the economic environment. Lam Wednesday said it was easing back on hiring to cope with the slowdown, joining numerous other technology and chip companies that have pulled back amid a choppier economic outlook. Semiconductors remain in hot demand in some areas. Lead times for automotive chips and those with industrial uses are still at or near historic highs, and chip makers that supply those industriesâ€”including the Dutch company NXP Semiconductors NV and Germany's Infineon Technologies AGâ€”have said recently that they still see few canceled or delayed orders.

The company announced the move after Vice reported on those sales. ""In addition, we urge you to take steps to stop the collection and disclosure of data related to abortion and reproductive rights,"" the groups wrote. Spokespeople for Oracle and Amazon did not return requests for comment.

Occidental Petroleum,OXY,2017/9/12,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, greenhouse gas emissions","Corporate Hurricane: Houston CEOs Race Mend Battered Workforce; Harvey swamped America's biggest corporate hubs, companies deploying no-interest loans work crews
""It's a small price to pay,"" said Jerry MacCleary, the North America chief for Germany's Covestro, which was forced to stop production at its Baytown manufacturing site, its biggest in the U.S., after Harvey knocked out key local suppliers and many of its employees couldn't get to work.
Managers said they are focused primarily on giving staff the time and help they need to take care of their homes and families and cope with deep personal loss.
The assistance companies are committing to flooded employees could be one of their biggest costs as they scramble to get back to work.
An informal poll by the Greater Houston Partnership, the regional chamber of commerce, found that the typical company had 10% to 11% of employees with homes substantially affected by flooding.
Company managers assigned flooded employees a score to determine how much assistance to provide: Level 1 meant minor home damage and an estimated recovery time of less than a month; Level 2 indicated recovery could take up to three months and that some temporary housing was required; and Level 3 signified total losses or major home damage and as much as six months of recovery and shelter were needed.
""It's the longer term that's tougher."" Three miles from Covestro's Baytown plant, a team of company employees worked Wednesday to finish stripping the inside of co-worker Javan Williamson's three-bedroom home down to its studsâ€”it had been flooded to 5 feet.
""I never thought a company I work for would be so willing to put out these types of resources,"" Mr. Williamson said.
Paul Kusserow, CEO of Baton Rouge-based Amedisys Inc., said it has taken until now for the home health-care company to fully recover from catastrophic floods last year that left a quarter of its 400 corporate employees with flooded homes and properties.
Mr. Kusserow estimated the company has spent ""well into the millions"" of dollars in housing, cash, counseling and other aid for displaced employees, plus countless hours helping them negotiate with insurers, purchasing supplies and finding quality contractors to rebuild workers' homes.
He said he has gotten calls from companies in Houston and Florida asking for advice in building their own employee-recovery plans.
As Harvey inundated Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Houston-area facilities with several feet of water, CEO Vicki Hollub tracked the whereabouts of the roughly 3,000 company employees in the storm's path using a company app and spreadsheetâ€”and called and texted some herself, along with other company leaders.
The company estimates more than 400 employees had to evacuate their homes, and roughly half of those suffered damage.
As he waded through waist-deep water around BP's corporate campus last week, John MingÃ©, president of BP America, said he realized it isn't just desks and cubicles that were swamped, but the company's expansive day-care center, too.
At Exxon Mobil, which has roughly 23,000 employees in Texas and Louisiana, senior executives held a conference call each day with about 50 people keeping tabs on the status of Exxon business units and personnel, said Steve Hart, vice president of global logistics and leader of Exxon's relief effort.","HOUSTONâ€”Chemicals maker Covestro AG set up a drive-through station for employees to pick up bleach, plastic tarps, gas and other emergency supplies. Occidental Petroleum Corp. is housing displaced staff in hotels and is giving out interest-free loans and $5,000 grants to pay for repairs. When Beaumont's water service failed, Exxon Mobil Corp. used a fleet of 36 helicopters to deliver water to employees and their families. ""It's a small price to pay,"" said Jerry MacCleary, the North America chief for Germany's Covestro, which was forced to stop production at its Baytown manufacturing site, its biggest in the U.S., after Harvey knocked out key local suppliers and many of its employees couldn't get to work. ""We can't run this place without people."" Never before in the modern era has a hurricane created such damage in one of America's major corporate hubs. Houston, the nation's fourth-largest city with 2.3 million people, is home to more Fortune 500 companies than any American metropolis except New York. The metro area, which includes the city, has an economy roughly the size of Sweden's. Harvey's record-setting floods, which have damaged or destroyed more than 300,000 homes in southeast Texas, disrupted lives here on a scale seldom before seen in the U.S., affecting executives and laborers alike. The scale of the problem is testing CEOs who see themselves as caretakers for their workers in and out of the office, and also as civic and community leaders in times of crisis. Managers said they are focused primarily on giving staff the time and help they need to take care of their homes and families and cope with deep personal loss. For now, the interests of employers and employees are alignedâ€”both want to get their lives in order and get back to work. In the long run, their interests may diverge, if costs become intolerable. Companies will face pressure to get back to full strength to meet business targets to satisfy customers and shareholders, economists and analysts say. Missteps could harm corporate images. It is a dilemma more bosses may soon face as a second major storm, Hurricane Irma, threatens to smash into the southeastern U.S. coastline this weekend. The assistance companies are committing to flooded employees could be one of their biggest costs as they scramble to get back to work. Many businesses estimated that plants and refineries will be back to 100% in weeks but that it will be months before employees are. An informal poll by the Greater Houston Partnership, the regional chamber of commerce, found that the typical company had 10% to 11% of employees with homes substantially affected by flooding. ""That's a very high level of impact that's hard to really make the office function as you'd like,"" said Bob Harvey, the Partnership's chief executive. Companies in some heavily flooded areas, such as oil and gas producer ConocoPhillips, were opting to keep main offices closed until next week. Productivity could drop 10% in the Gulf Coast region for at least the next two months, which would cause a $3 billion reduction in economic output, said Ray Perryman, a Texas economist and forecaster based in Waco. Covestro, a maker of raw materials for adhesives, polyurethanes and other chemicals spun off from the pharmaceuticals giant Bayer AG in 2015, estimated 15% of its more than 1,000 Houston-area staff were hit by flooding. Company managers assigned flooded employees a score to determine how much assistance to provide: Level 1 meant minor home damage and an estimated recovery time of less than a month; Level 2 indicated recovery could take up to three months and that some temporary housing was required; and Level 3 signified total losses or major home damage and as much as six months of recovery and shelter were needed. Of the roughly 150 employees who sustained damage, more than 60 were either Level 2 or 3. ""All the stuff we're doing in the first couple of weeks, those are, in a way, the easier things,"" said Mr. MacCleary, the North America chief. ""It's the longer term that's tougher."" Three miles from Covestro's Baytown plant, a team of company employees worked Wednesday to finish stripping the inside of co-worker Javan Williamson's three-bedroom home down to its studsâ€”it had been flooded to 5 feet. Water covered the SUV in the garage and set the backyard deck afloat like a raft, saving the two dogs that had been left behind when Mr. Williamsonâ€”expecting only a few inches of floodingâ€”moved his pregnant wife and two small daughters to a friend's house for what he thought would be the night. A co-worker, Brett Ward, later waded with him through waist-high water to rescue the dogs. On Wednesday, the family's ruined belongingsâ€”nearly all of themâ€”were piled high on the sidewalk around the house: a couch, a mirror, various toys. Mr. Williamson's wife, Jill, said the couple's wedding photos were a total loss, but some snapshots of the children would dry. Covestro also lent the Williamsons a car and is arranging a furnished apartment for the family for three months. ""I never thought a company I work for would be so willing to put out these types of resources,"" Mr. Williamson said. ""Allowing me to be off work and not worrying about my job is absolutely critical."" Companies now tending to their employees are likely in for a long haul. Paul Kusserow, CEO of Baton Rouge-based Amedisys Inc., said it has taken until now for the home health-care company to fully recover from catastrophic floods last year that left a quarter of its 400 corporate employees with flooded homes and properties. Mr. Kusserow estimated the company has spent ""well into the millions"" of dollars in housing, cash, counseling and other aid for displaced employees, plus countless hours helping them negotiate with insurers, purchasing supplies and finding quality contractors to rebuild workers' homes. ""Even if it's not a question of economics, you as an employer get so much in return,"" he said. ""What we got was a lot of good will and a lot of cohesion and loyalty."" He said he believes the effort is one reason the company's turnover rate has fallen to about 18% from the low-30% range before the floods. Amedisys never hit a point where it considered pulling back and didn't feel pressure from investors to rein in spending, he said. ""Our board wrote checks, and I expected them to write checks,"" said Mr. Kusserow. He said he has gotten calls from companies in Houston and Florida asking for advice in building their own employee-recovery plans. ""It ain't that tough. You just got to give,"" he said. As Harvey inundated Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s Houston-area facilities with several feet of water, CEO Vicki Hollub tracked the whereabouts of the roughly 3,000 company employees in the storm's path using a company app and spreadsheetâ€”and called and texted some herself, along with other company leaders. Ms. Hollub knows many of the workers personally because she came up through the ranks of the company. ""I would see names missing,"" said Ms. Hollub, adding, ""We were trying to make sure we hadn't missed anybody."" All staff were eventually accounted for. The company estimates more than 400 employees had to evacuate their homes, and roughly half of those suffered damage. ""If employees are stressed about their personal situation, they can't really do a good job, and we wouldn't expect them to,"" Ms. Hollub said. BP PLC, which has 5,000 employees in Houston, shut down its corporate campus after its main office tower flooded. BP temporarily moved part of its wind business unit to Barber County, Kansas, and many oil and gas employees are working remotely from home. It has a plan to get roughly 60% of its Houston crew over coming weeks into shared workspace in its buildings that didn't flood. As he waded through waist-deep water around BP's corporate campus last week, John MingÃ©, president of BP America, said he realized it isn't just desks and cubicles that were swamped, but the company's expansive day-care center, too. About 300 children are cared for from early in the morning until the end of the workday. ""This is going to create stress, and we'll have to work through it,"" he said of working parents who counted on campus child care. At Exxon Mobil, which has roughly 23,000 employees in Texas and Louisiana, senior executives held a conference call each day with about 50 people keeping tabs on the status of Exxon business units and personnel, said Steve Hart, vice president of global logistics and leader of Exxon's relief effort. Mr. Hart and his team also guided operational priorities such as the refinery shutdowns and startups. He said he realized only later that some people on the calls coordinating the recovery were trying to manage their own flooded homes. Some had moved in with co-workers and quietly kept doing their jobs. ""They look at this as their role,"" Mr. Hart said. ""They know that this is what they need to do."" Reno Castillo, an Exxon instrument specialist, was among a large crew of critical employees that stayed at the Baytown refining and chemical complex and helped safely shut it down during the storm. He and others were stuck at the plant for days after floodwaters cut off access. He eventually got homeâ€”traveling at one point on a friend's bass boatâ€”where his house was also flooded with two feet of water. Exxon hired a crew to rip out drywall and clean upâ€”one of more than 100 contractors the company has mobilized to help employees. In less than a week, his home was ready to start renovations, and by Tuesday he was able to get back to work on the turbines in the Baytown plant. ""They were trying to get my life back in order as quickly as possible,"" he said. Once people get back to work, ""their attention is going to be divided,"" said Curt Ross, a managing director in the Houston office of recruiting and consulting firm Russell Reynolds Associates. ""These people are going to be talking to insurance companies and adjusters and contractors for months."" He estimated it could be six months before workers return to full productivity. ""Given that people will need time offâ€¦absenteeism is likely to be a drain on productivity,"" said Mr. Perryman, the economist. ""Perhaps an even greater concern will be 'presenteeism,' where workers are physically present but preoccupied with family and property concerns."" Bradley Olson contributed to this article.

PepsiCo announced Feb. 9, 2021, that it would be known going forward as Pearl Milling Company. Just in time for Juneteenth, Quaker Oats announced that the Aunt Jemima brand will be retired as its parent company PepsiCo works to ""make progress toward racial equality."" Like that of the enslaved black people in Texas who remained in bondage years after President Abraham Lincoln had granted their freedom, the emancipation of Aunt Jemima is way behind schedule. I mean, really, why did it take this long? Her name should have fallen off boxes and bottles years ago, and the fact that it didn't suggests that the companies that controlled the brand for more than a century have all been slaves to profit â€?holding onto a valuable trademark that's internationally known and historically offensive. I admit to having a complicated relationship with Aunt Jemima. She occupies a secret branch of my family tree. For a period of time in the late 1940s and early 1950s, my grandmother, Ione Brown, was part of an army of women who worked as traveling Aunt Jemimas, visiting small-town fairs and rotary-club breakfasts to conduct pancake-making demonstrations at a time when the notion of ready-mix convenience cooking was new. I never knew about my grandmother's work until long after she died. It was one of those things my family never really talked about. I learned about it while researching a family memoir called ""The Grace of Silence."" I learned that she made good money and covered a region including Iowa, the Dakotas, Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. She was often treated like a celebrity in small towns, but could not stay in local hotels. She kept an eye out for houses that had a small sign in the window that said ""TOURIST,"" a code for homes that provided lodging and meals to black people. This is a complicated legacy for my family. Ione was a civic leader in Minneapolis, founder of a senior center that is still thriving today on 38th Street, a few blocks from where George Floyd was killed last month. As a family, we are offended by the caricature that Aunt Jemima represents, but deeply proud of the way my grandmother used the stage that was available to lift herself up. You see, in those days Aunt Jemima didn't look like the lady you see on the box today. She was a slave woman, and Ione was expected to act and talk like a slave woman, using the kind of broken patois that blighted the full-page ads in magazines like Women's Day and Life. But the women who represented the brand often refused to follow that script. They wore the costume because the company refused to let them show up in a smart suit, but in many cases, they dropped the broken English. My grandmother sang gospel songs so people would know she was a woman of God, and she focused on children because she knew that many of those little white boys and girls had never seen a black woman before. She must have blown their minds when she served pancakes, reciting Bible verses and poetry from heart in the crisp diction I remember from childhood, when she would fuss at me and my cousins for droppin' the letter ""g"" from the end of our words. I peered into my grandmother's history with dread and trepidation. I emerged with a deep well of respect for how she and women with names like Rosa, Joburness, Edith and Aylene flipped the stereotype on its head to show America what black elegance sounded like, even while wearing a headscarf and an apron. Quaker Oats, on the other hand, earned my ire on several fronts. Aunt Jemima was based on the idea that you could have a servant in your kitchen, smiling from the box, easing your burden, and it has been that way since the brand was first created back in 1889. Quaker Oats ignored boycotts and petitions and instead engaged in a tortured series of makeovers that amount to a process of attempted de-mammification. Jemima's do-rag was replaced by a plaid headband. Eventually the headdress was dropped altogether. A 1989 rebrand made her look like someone who shops at Macy's: Coifed hair. Pearl earrings. Red lipstick. At various points, the company turned for help to consultants like Caroline Jones, who ran the nation's top black ad agency, and who told the company: ""White people may have long forgotten the slaves of old, but no Black person can."" PepsiCo, which acquired Quaker Oats in 2001, has now realized that de-mammification is not the same as destigmatization. There is now a growing list of outfits revisiting troubling brands. The country group Lady Antebellum has changed its name to Lady A. NASCAR has banned the use of the Confederate flag. The Mars Company is trying to decide what to do about Uncle Ben. Time to retire him, too. The companies that clung to these brands need to do some honest soul-searching to own up to why they waited so long to let go. One of the things that irks me most about the Jemima brand is the way the mammy stereotype hijacked what should be an endearing image for black America and tried to turn it into something toxic. Most of us have someone in our family with fleshy arms and a loving smile who serves up cherished advice along with delicious food. They are our aunts and mothers and grandmothers. Our godmothers. Our queens. You tried to make us ashamed of what Aunt Jemima stood for. But we have always known that the real women the silent spokeswoman was supposed to represent deserved crowns on their heads instead of a do-rag.","<Incident Category>: local pollution, misleading communication, plastics, social discrimination, racism racial inequality

The correlation between the incident category and the matched summary is that the incident category, which includes local pollution, misleading communication, plastics, social discrimination, and racism racial inequality, is addressed in the summary. The summary touches upon the issue of racism and racial inequality, specifically referencing the Mammy stereotype and the enslaved black people in Texas who remained in bondage years after President Abraham Lincoln had granted their freedom. The summary also acknowledges the way the mammy stereotype hijacked an endearing image for black America.

Details of how the fire started will be investigated. The statement added: ""First responders are on-site working to ensure the fire is controlled and quickly put out. All employees and people who were in the facility have been evacuated with no injuries.â€?A USA TODAY Network photographer could see flames, some as high as 12 feet, from the street illuminating the night sky. Firefighters were also searching nearby woods for possible hot spots. â€œThis has been here since the late â€?0s and there had never been a fire here before, Wahler said. â€œIf you drink Mountain Dew, it comes from Piscataway,â€?he said. While the fire was under control, there were four trucks to pour water onto the roof and firefighters would be doing so through the night. They were rushing water from New Market Pond to supplement their reserves, he explained. â€œFrom what I understand, all the drills theyâ€™ve done throughout the years paid off,â€?the mayor said. In a statement posted on Facebook, the municipal government wrote: â€œA major structural fire is occurring in Piscataway and residents are asked to avoid New Brunswick Avenue, Carlton Avenue and Lakeview Avenue to enable first responder vehicles to access it.

PepsiCo â€?the parent company of iconic brands like Pepsi, Lay's, Gatorade, and Quaker Old Fashioned Oats â€?has been committed to environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, initiatives for several years.
In 2021, the consumer packaged goods company expanded that commitment with the debut of PepsiCo Positive, a strategic sustainability and governance plan focusing on three pillars: agriculture, value chain, and choices.
""It's a strategic end-to-end transformation with sustainability and human capital at the center,"" Anna Palazij, PepsiCo's vice president of ESG reporting and strategic investments, told Insider.
""What we're trying to do is transform the way we source our products in a more sustainable way, how we manufacture our products, and how we bring them to consumers."" PepsiCo has been a leader in the ESG space.
Palazij said PepsiCo Positive aims to drive growth internally and throughout the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry.
Sustainability and governance are interconnected Governance is intertwined with PepsiCo's ESG goal-setting and progress reporting.
""Our governance starts at the top of PepsiCo,"" Palazij said, adding that executive compensation is tied to sustainability performance and progress.
""People are such an important part of PepsiCo and sustainability as a whole, and ultimately our PepsiCo Positive agenda looks at how we drive better outcomes for people and the planet,"" Palazij said.

PepsiCo â€?the parent company of iconic brands like Pepsi, Lay's, Gatorade, and Quaker Old Fashioned Oats â€?has been committed to environmental, social, and governance, or ESG, initiatives for several years. In 2021, the consumer packaged goods company expanded that commitment with the debut of PepsiCo Positive, a strategic sustainability and governance plan focusing on three pillars: agriculture, value chain, and choices. ""It's a strategic end-to-end transformation with sustainability and human capital at the center,"" Anna Palazij, PepsiCo's vice president of ESG reporting and strategic investments, told Insider. ""What we're trying to do is transform the way we source our products in a more sustainable way, how we manufacture our products, and how we bring them to consumers."" PepsiCo has been a leader in the ESG space. The company recently ranked second on the 2022 list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens by 3BL Media, and it's made the list every year since 2009. Palazij said PepsiCo Positive aims to drive growth internally and throughout the consumer packaged goods (CPG) industry. Expanding its ESG commitment comes as investors, suppliers, stakeholders, and customers are asking for more commitments on sustainability. The CPG industry is also feeling strained through droughts and hotter temperatures. Governance is crucial to all of this because it ensures companies are setting goals, tracking performance, and reporting to stakeholders to ensure accountability. ""We knew that now was the time to act, and we felt a responsibility and an opportunity,"" Palazij said. PepsiCo Positive is a standalone ESG program to help the company grow and become more resilient for the future. It's embedded into the company's overall financial framework, Palazij said. PepsiCo issued a $1 billion green bond in 2019 to produce a more sustainable food system by focusing on better packaging, decarbonization of operations and supply chain, and water sustainability. At the end of 2020, PepsiCo had distributed $858 million of the bond, which had helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions and water use and improve energy efficiency. Here's a look at how PepsiCo is transforming its business operations to produce products more sustainably. Sustainability and governance are interconnected Governance is intertwined with PepsiCo's ESG goal-setting and progress reporting. PepsiCo aligns its sustainability efforts with the Science-Based Targets initiative, which ensures it's meeting ambitious goals that follow the latest climate science. For example, the company plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 â€?meaning the greenhouse gas emissions produced are balanced with emission reductions â€?and be net water positive by 2030, in which the company will replenish more water than it uses. In 2020, PepsiCo achieved 100% renewable electricity in its US operations, which is the company's largest market, and plans to expand that to 15 countries by the end of 2021. Progress on sustainability is reviewed by the Executive Council, which comprises members of the executive leadership team. ""Our governance starts at the top of PepsiCo,"" Palazij said, adding that executive compensation is tied to sustainability performance and progress. PepsiCo regularly shares progress on ESG initiatives with stakeholders, including investors and consumers. The company provides updates on its website, where it lists details for more than 50 ESG topics, including environmental impact, people, product and nutrition, and ethics and governance. ""We continue to look at what's needed to be transparent and tell our story, but in an authentic and transparent way, and we align our reporting to that,"" Palazij said. Supporting people and communities is central to the value chain commitment Creating a safe and equitable environment for employees, the communities it reaches, and everyone involved in its supply chain is a key part of PepsiCo's initiatives. ""People are such an important part of PepsiCo and sustainability as a whole, and ultimately our PepsiCo Positive agenda looks at how we drive better outcomes for people and the planet,"" Palazij said. And that spans the full value chain from the farmers who grow the crops to the consumers who enjoy them. PepsiCo plans to expand regenerative farming across 7 million acres and so far has rolled out regenerative farming on 345,000 acres. The company, Palazij said, is committed to improving the livelihood of the 250,000 people in its agriculture supply chain through partnerships with the National Black Growers Council and the US Agency for International Development. PepsiCo plans to sustainably source 100% of ingredients, like oats and potatoes â€?a goal it's already achieved in some countries. The company also hopes to provide safe water access to 100 million people by 2030, and Palazij said the company now delivers water to 68 million people globally. Building diverse, inclusive, and equitable workplaces across the company is part of its commitment to people. In 2020, PepsiCo launched the Racial Equity Journey with plans to invest $570 million in the next five years to support Black and Hispanic businesses and communities. PepsiCo also pledged $100 million through 2025 to support opportunities for women in the workforce. Driving ESG innovation to improve the packaged goods industry PepsiCo's recognition for its ESG initiatives helps validate the value of the company's work and shows that it's resonating with stakeholders and others in the industry, Palazij said. The company seeks to drive innovation in sustainability through its PepsiCo Labs program, which works with venture capital to identify new technology to help accelerate its sustainability agenda. PepsiCo champions innovation from competitors, which ultimately improves the CPG sector as a whole. ""Consumers consume our products more than a billion times a day, so we have a unique opportunity from a size and scale standpoint to transform,"" Palazij said. ""We think that is both an obligation and an opportunity to change the way business is done. It goes beyond the competition with others because we want everyone engaged in this collaboration."" @media (min-width: 960px) { #piano-inline-content-wrapper .content-header .figure.image-figure-image { min-width: 100%; margin-left: 0; } } Read the original article on Business Insider","<Incident Category>: human rights abuses and corporate complicity, impacts on communities, impacts on landscapes, overuse and wasting of resources, health impact, land ecosystems, water scarcity

Moderna In the early days of the vaccine rollout in the U.S., Pfizer somehow became the â€œstatus vaccineâ€?â€?the subject of memes and funny jokes about the â€œhot peopleâ€?in the â€œPfizer Gang.â€? somehow became the â€œstatus vaccineâ€?â€?the subject of memes and funny jokes about These tongue-in-cheek references emerged after the results of initial clinical trials showed that Pfizer had a 95 percent efficacy against symptomatic infection, compared with Modernaâ€™s 94 percent.
Over the past few weeks, a half-dozen studies have demonstrated that Modernaâ€™s vaccine appears to be more protective over the long term than Pfizerâ€™s.
For example, research published last week by the C.D.C. found that the efficacy of Pfizerâ€™s vaccine against hospitalization fell to 77 percent from 91 percent after a four-month period following the second shot.
For example, the Pfizer vaccine was introduced weeks before Modernaâ€™s to priority groups, including older adults.
Still, a number of studies â€?from Qatar, the Mayo Clinic and several U.S. states â€?show Modernaâ€™s efficacy against severe illness ranging from 92 to 100 percent, while Pfizerâ€™s numbers trail by 10 to 15 percentage points.
In two other studies, the Moderna vaccine did better at preventing infection, too â€?by more than 30 percentage points.
When it comes to severe illness and hospitalization, both are still highly effective.â€?Bidenâ€™s Covid summit At the opening of a virtual Covid-19 summit organized with the U.N., President Biden called on world leaders, pharmaceutical executives, philanthropists and civil society organizations to forge a global consensus around a plan to fight the coronavirus crisis .
â€œItâ€™s an all-hands-on-deck crisis.â€?The president pointed to two especially urgent challenges: vaccinating the world and solving a global oxygen shortage, which is leading to unnecessary Covid deaths.
Health officials in the U.S. and abroad are now ratcheting up pressure on Pfizer and Moderna to do more to address the global shortage  â€?including sharing their formulas with manufacturers in nations that desperately need more shots.
Global health advocates say Moderna has a special obligation to share its technology because its vaccine relies in part on technology developed by the National Institutes of Health.
Earlier today, Pfizer announced that it had struck a deal with the Biden administration to sell the U.S. an additional 500 million doses of its vaccine at a not-for-profit price to donate overseas, rather than license its technology.

Health officials, meanwhile, were adamant: Doses from Pfizer and Moderna are equally effective, they said. But as my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reports, that has turned out not to be true . Over the past few weeks, a half-dozen studies have demonstrated that Modernaâ€™s vaccine appears to be more protective over the long term than Pfizerâ€™s. For example, research published last week by the C.D.C. found that the efficacy of Pfizerâ€™s vaccine against hospitalization fell to 77 percent from 91 percent after a four-month period following the second shot. The Moderna shot showed no decline over the same period. Scientists who were initially skeptical of the reported differences have slowly become convinced that the disparity is small but real. â€œPfizer is a big hammer,â€?said Dr. Jeffrey Wilson, an immunologist and physician at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. â€œModerna is a sledgehammer.â€?The results from studies on the varying effects of the vaccines can be skewed by any number of factors. For example, the Pfizer vaccine was introduced weeks before Modernaâ€™s to priority groups, including older adults. Immunity wanes more quickly in that group, so a decline in a group consisting mostly of older adults may give the false impression that the protection from the Pfizer vaccine falls off quickly. Still, a number of studies â€?from Qatar, the Mayo Clinic and several U.S. states â€?show Modernaâ€™s efficacy against severe illness ranging from 92 to 100 percent, while Pfizerâ€™s numbers trail by 10 to 15 percentage points. In two other studies, the Moderna vaccine did better at preventing infection, too â€?by more than 30 percentage points. At the end of the day, there may be real differences in the two vaccines, but how much will it matter in the real world? â€œProbably not much,â€?Apoorva said. â€œEven though the Pfizer-BioNTech trails Moderna by a bit, the difference is mostly in protection from infection. When it comes to severe illness and hospitalization, both are still highly effective.â€?Bidenâ€™s Covid summit At the opening of a virtual Covid-19 summit organized with the U.N., President Biden called on world leaders, pharmaceutical executives, philanthropists and civil society organizations to forge a global consensus around a plan to fight the coronavirus crisis . â€œWe need to go big,â€?Biden said. â€œItâ€™s an all-hands-on-deck crisis.â€?The president pointed to two especially urgent challenges: vaccinating the world and solving a global oxygen shortage, which is leading to unnecessary Covid deaths. But the task is daunting. Less than 10 percent of the population of poor nations â€?and less than 4 percent of the African population â€?has been fully vaccinated. Covax, the W.H.O.-backed international vaccine initiative, is behind schedule in delivering shots to the nations that need them the most. Health officials in the U.S. and abroad are now ratcheting up pressure on Pfizer and Moderna to do more to address the global shortage  â€?including sharing their formulas with manufacturers in nations that desperately need more shots. Global health advocates say Moderna has a special obligation to share its technology because its vaccine relies in part on technology developed by the National Institutes of Health. The company also accepted $2.5 billion from the federal government as part of Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administrationâ€™s fast-track vaccine initiative. Earlier today, Pfizer announced that it had struck a deal with the Biden administration to sell the U.S. an additional 500 million doses of its vaccine at a not-for-profit price to donate overseas, rather than license its technology. Some legal experts say the Biden administration could try to force the companies to share their intellectual property, using the powers of the Defense Production Act. But Biden administration officials say that would lead to a drawn-out legal battle, which would be counterproductive. Postponing non-Covid care During the last two months, hospitals across America have been overwhelmed by the Delta surge. Now, as my colleague Reed Abelson reports, some non-Covid patients are waiting several weeks for care â€?if not longer . In Idaho, one of the least vaccinated states, hospitals have started postponing cancer and heart surgeries. Doctors in some of the hardest-hit areas, like Alaska and Idaho , have been forced to ration care. â€œWe donâ€™t have enough resources to adequately treat the patients in our hospitals, whether you are there for Covid-19 or a heart attack or because of a car accident,â€?Dave Jeppesen, the director of the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare, said in a statement.

Write to Josh Nathan-Kazis at josh.nathan-kazis@barrons.com Pfizer CEO Talks About Covid Vaccines and What Comes Next: 'I Think We Are Undervalued.'","Albert Bourla, the CEO of Pfizer, is perhaps the most sought-after corporate executive in the world this fall. His company's Covid-19 vaccine is in demand around the globe, and new data on his company's Covid-19 pill has shaken the market. At the same time, Bourla and Pfizer, which he has led since 2019, are under growing pressure over the vastly unequal global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. Last weekend, Barron's argued in a magazine feature that the dual successes of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine and its Covid-19 oral antiviral show that Bourla was right to slim down the company two years ago, shedding businesses to focus on developing new drugs. Investors have been slow to come along, and Pfizer (ticker: PFE) still trades at a discount to its big pharma peers. Still, in recent days, the stock has surged, closing above $50 on Wednesday for only the third time in at least 15 years. Barron's spoke with Bourla on Wednesday. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity. Barron's: The White House is rolling out a plan to expand Covid-19 vaccine manufacturing in the U.S. What do you think of this idea, and what will Pfizer's role be? Albert Bourla: I'm waiting to see the needs of the U.S. government. Conceptually, I think it's a very good initiative. Yes, of course, we will play a key role. I'm just waiting to see the details. MORE ON PFIZER * Pfizer Lands $5.29 Billion From U.S. for Covid-19 Pill It seems as though the White House plan is to give manufacturers money to expand manufacturing in the U.S. Is capital the limiting factor on your vaccine production right now? No. We have infrastructure in the U.S. that is making way more than a billion doses. We may discuss how to make sure that we maintain it hot over the time, so that if the demand is going down that we don't scale down. Those I think are things that should be discussed, but I don't think we need to build more infrastructure. The bottleneck right now in the world are raw materials. The reason why our capacity is going up and up and up is not that we are bringing more buildings or equipment, it's that we have an ability to source more raw materials. You said to Barron's earlier this month that thereason more of the doses of your vaccine have gone to poor countries is that those countries have been slow to place orders with you. Bloomberg recently reported that Pfizer is the top supplier of Covid-19 vaccines to wealthy countries. Does Pfizer have a responsibility to ensure its vaccine is being distributed fairly? Absolutely, I think it is part of our responsibilities, and it is anyway part of our culture to have equity in particular when it comes to healthcare. The reason why in the beginning of the year we had way more going to high income countries, and why we are giving in the second part of the year more to the poorest countries, was that when we were seeking orders, only the high-income countries placed. I saw that, at that moment, and I got very concerned. Because everything that we had produced or forecast to produce was going all exclusively to the high-income countries that were placing orders. I wrote letters to heads of state, I asked them to place orders. They decided to go different ways. And I don't blame them. Nobody knew at the time that mRNA would be the solution. When the situation became more clear that we have way higher efficacy and the production of other solutions was not as real as it was promised, this was when they came back to us and asked us for more. And the solution we found was to increase dramatically our production. We argued in a feature over the weekend that the Covid-19 pill and the vaccine together have proven the power of your R&D operation. It seems as though investors still need some convincing, and your stock trades at a steep discount to Eli Lilly (LLY), for example. I wonder what you think it will take to bring these investors along. Clearly, after we made some changes to the portfolio of our businesses in the beginning of 2019, the investor base started to change. Some of the value investors started thinking that a company that is focusing on science would be maybe not what they want in a portfolio, so maybe we had some exits of those at that time. You go faster than you are coming into something new. So the growth investors, they were taking their time. I think we are undervalued. We are not even close to the multiple of Lilly or AstraZeneca (AZN). But I think that there is a tremendous opportunity, and those that need more proof points, they will get them, but then the stock will be more expensive for them. Your Covid-19 vaccine has brought a windfall of cash for the company. What will you do with the cash? Do you have M&A plans? The successes of the company during the pandemic, both scientific and financial, they do not change the strategy we set before. If anything, they reinforce the belief and the conviction that we were on the right path, which was to bet the company on science. We may have higher flexibility now with capital, but I don't think we had a lack of capital before. Our strategy, when it comes to capital allocation, is we want to maintain a growing dividend. This is something that is a big part of our investment thesis. Our priority is to in-license or acquire scientific technologies or projects that are at Phase 2-ready, Phase 3-ready. Once they come into our machine of clinical development, they will progress rapidly into medicines that can save lives, and as a result have a good financial return for the company. The patent cliff Pfizer is approaching at the end of the decade is obviously a major concern for investors. How are you now preparing for that moment? We are not preparing for anything that is unusual. This is the normal course of business. Investors used to, 10, 20 years ago, assign to pharma companies very, very high multiples. Now they're assigning the lowest multiple in the industry. That's a mistake. It's completely against the investment dynamics I see ahead of me. What I see is demographics that are extremely favorable for a business like ours. People are getting older. This not only creates higher usage of medicines, but creates mainly the need for new medicines, because new diseases are coming up. You announced a deal this week to allow generic drugmakers to manufacture your Covid-19 pill and sell it in middle-income and low-income countries. You won't receive a royalty on these sales during the pandemic. How much will this cost Pfizer? It is covering 53% of the population, and clearly it's not going to be 53% of expected revenues, but it's a significant part of the world, and includes many countries where we do business. I didn't make a calculation, because that was not the point. We needed to have some institutional principles here. Why not do the same with the vaccine? It's a very different story. This is a small molecule. A small molecule, there are many qualified generic manufacturers that can make it. The vaccine is the highest, most challenging technology to manufacture in the world right now; making lipid nanoparticles and storing them in minus seventy degrees. I don't think in three years someone would be able to make it. Thanks, Albert.

You said to Barron's earlier this month that thereason more of the doses of your vaccine have gone to poor countries is that those countries have been slow to place orders with you.
Bloomberg recently reported that Pfizer is the top supplier of Covid-19 vaccines to wealthy countries.
The reason why in the beginning of the year we had way more going to high income countries, and why we are giving in the second part of the year more to the poorest countries, was that when we were seeking orders, only the high-income countries placed.
Some of the value investors started thinking that a company that is focusing on science would be maybe not what they want in a portfolio, so maybe we had some exits of those at that time.
Your Covid-19 vaccine has brought a windfall of cash for the company.
Investors used to, 10, 20 years ago, assign to pharma companies very, very high multiples.
The vaccine is the highest, most challenging technology to manufacture in the world right now; making lipid nanoparticles and storing them in minus seventy degrees.
I don't think in three years someone would be able to make it.

Pfizer,PFE,2022/1/5,"tax optimization, tax havens","CDC chief endorses plan youths age 12-15 booster: Live COVID updates
A CDC advisory panel earlier in the day had voted 13-1 in favor of recommending that 12- to 15-year-olds get a booster dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and Walensky quickly endorsed the suggestion.
This booster dose will provide optimized protection against COVID-19 and the Omicron variant.
The Food and Drug Administration authorized the booster earlier this week, basing its decision largely on data from Israel that found no new safety concerns when 6,300 12- to 15-year-olds got a Pfizer booster five months after their second dose.
About 13.5 million 12- to 17-year-olds â€?just over half that age group population â€?have received two Pfizer shots, according to the CDC.
The CDC committee emphasized that primary vaccinations and masking are even more important than boosters in preventing severe disease and transmission.
The U.S. averaged 491,000 new infections daily over the last seven-day period, almost double the previous seven days, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House briefing Wednesday.

Unvaccinated tennis star Novak Djokovic denied entry into Australia for tournament Novak Djokovic, the world's No. 1 men's tennis player and a nine-time Australian Open champion, has been denied entry into Australia for this year's tournament over visa irregularities linked to his medical exemption from getting the COVID vaccine.
Djokovic, who has been openly disdainful of COVID vaccines and mitigation measures, said Tuesday that he had been granted an exemption, an announcement that drew severe backlash.
Ernby had opposed government-required vaccinations for children in the past and as recently as December voiced her resistance to mandating COVID vaccines, saying, ""There's nothing that matters more than our freedoms right now.â€?Her death from the disease sparked a firestorm of social media responses, and some commenters expressed their condolences to her husband, Mattias Ernby.

The committee also strengthened its recommendation that 16- and 17-year-olds also should get a booster.

That's the contention of an organization that typically sides with the nation's health protection agency -- the American Medical Association. The guidelines, issued Dec. 27, shortened the amount of time those infected with the virus or exposed to it are required to stay away from others to five days. After that, provided the person in question has no symptoms or those are resolving, the CDC recommends wearing a mask around others for five days. That's not enough, says the AMA, which contends that based on the CDC's own information, about 31% of those who test positive for the virus could remain infectious five days later. ""Physicians are concerned that these recommendations put our patients at risk and could further overwhelm our health care system,'' the AMA's president, Dr. Gerald E. Harmon, said in a statement. â€œA negative test should be required for ending isolation after one tests positive for COVID-19. Reemerging without knowing oneâ€™s status unnecessarily risks further transmission of the virus.'' 'She was NOT vaccinated. That was the problem.' Southern California politician dies of COVID at 46 The COVID death of a Southern California politician who opposed vaccine mandates has stirred a heated debate about inoculations on her husband's Facebook page. Orange County Deputy District Attorney Kelly Ernby, a Republican who ran for the state Assembly in 2020 and planned to pursue a seat again this year, died of COVID this week at 46. Ernby had opposed government-required vaccinations for children in the past and as recently as December voiced her resistance to mandating COVID vaccines, saying, ""There's nothing that matters more than our freedoms right now.â€?Her death from the disease sparked a firestorm of social media responses, and some commenters expressed their condolences to her husband, Mattias Ernby. However, others had more pointed remarks, including one named Len Thomas who wrote, ""If your wife would have been vaccinated, She'd still be alive.'' No one's words were as poignant as those of Mattias Ernby, who in correcting those who claimed Kelly Ernby had gotten the COVID vaccine, wrote: ""She was NOT vaccinated. That was the problem."" 'We can't vaccinate the planet every 4 to 6 months,' vaccine creator warns The U.S. and other developed countries are pondering a second booster for their populations, but a co-creator of the AstraZeneca vaccine warns that ""we can't vaccinate the planet every four to six months."" ""It's not sustainable or affordable,"" Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told the Daily Telegraph. Pollard said the vaccination effort must target the vulnerable. Pollard estimates that 9 billion COVID vaccine doses, including those made by AstraZeneca, have been given worldwide since the first non-trial doses were jabbed in late 2020. He said the effort to keep everyone protected from infection must be abandoned. ""At some point, society has to open up. When we do open, there will be a period with a bump in infections, which is why winter is probably not the best time,"" he told the Telegraph. ""But that's a decision for the policymakers, not the scientists."" Pollard, in an interview with Sky News, said it is too early to say whether future coronavirus variants will be milder than those that emerged earlier in the pandemic. ""I don't think we can be sure at this moment that future versions of coronavirus, the sons and daughters of omicron, will be causing mild disease,"" he added. Supreme Court hears challenge to federal mandates amid historic surge The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments in challenges to two federal vaccine requirements Friday at a time when the omicron variant is causing infections to soar. While the justices have repeatedly turned away challenges to state and local COVID-19 vaccine mandates, the Biden administration is all but guaranteed to face a tougher reception.

P&G will aim to end buying pulp, a key ingredient in its top-selling Charmin toilet paper, from certain forests in Canada and develop a plan to reduce purchases of the raw material from other swaths of woodland, according to an agreement the consumer products company made with an investor last month.
Wood pulp helps P&Gâ€™s Charmin and Bounty paper towels feel soft and more absorbent, and the company says consumers prefer them.

A widely-used tool called the Paper Calculator, managed by the Environmental Paper Network, however, shows P&G's emissions from wood pulp purchases alone tally 17.8 million metric tons, eclipsing the company's total supply chain emissions.","NEW YORK, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co will take steps aimed at reducing potential harm to forests from its purchases of wood pulp for toilet paper and other consumer goods, after being pressured by environmentalists and investors for more sweeping changes. P&G will aim to end buying pulp, a key ingredient in its top-selling Charmin toilet paper, from certain forests in Canada and develop a plan to reduce purchases of the raw material from other swaths of woodland, according to an agreement the consumer products company made with an investor last month. P&G faces scrutiny from environmental non-profits and some investors in part because it lags its publicly-traded peers in using recycled paper and fibers in household staples like toilet paper. P&G has not made pledges to cut its purchases of pulp, which is harvested from logged trees. Environmental groups say pulp harvesting takes a heavy toll on the environment. Wood pulp helps P&Gâ€™s Charmin and Bounty paper towels feel soft and more absorbent, and the company says consumers prefer them. P&G says its competitors making premium toilet paper all exclusively use virgin wood pulp as well. But rival Kimberly Clark Corp, which makes Cottonelle toilet paper, has vowed to reduce its reliance on natural forest fibers, which include pulp. It also makes a Scott toilet paper with 100% recycled material. Unilever Plc sells a Seventh Generation brand of 100% recycled toilet paper, paper towels and tissue. P&G's agreement with investor Green Century Capital Management Inc was filed July 18 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. P&G also updated its forestry practices section of its website in late July to include most of the agreement. In that update, P&G said it has created and is testing two new Charmin products, one made with plant-based fiber and another with bamboo. 'HEAD IN THE SAND' P&G and some of its investors and non-profits are deeply divided on the environmental impact of the company's sole reliance on virgin pulp. P&G, which had its own pulp and timber business until the early 1990s, says all of its pulp comes from sustainably managed forests and tree plantations, limiting negative effects on the environment. It cites climate experts saying that those forests take more climate-warming greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere than they emit, from the time they are grown to when they are harvested. The pulp supply chain starts generating greenhouse gases once the trees are loaded on to trucks and processed, said Tonia Elrod, a spokeswoman for P&G's family care brands, which includes its paper products, and responsible sourcing initiatives. Environmental non-profits, however, argue that some forests P&G sources its pulp from are ultimately degraded, and that the company is likely underestimating its impact on the environment. They say the argument by companies that planting a tree or two to make up for the harm of another cut down ignores the larger impact of cutting down old forests. ""P&G has buried its head in the sand for a long time,"" said Jennifer Skene, a policy manager at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ""They are treating the forest as replaceable."" Nicole Rycroft, executive director of Canopy, a Vancouver supply chain consultant, said it can take 60 to 150 years or more to get back to carbon neutral after a longstanding forest is logged. New guidance on land use is being developed to close those loopholes and offer improved carbon accounting. There are also efforts underway to help companies set targets to reduce emissions from land use. P&G is participating in both. The company says the pulp it buys is all certified to ensure no deforestation. 'SMALL PORTION' P&G's new efforts are a ""step in the right direction"" and over time, will help reduce its environmental impact, said Thomas Peterson, a shareholder advocate with Green Century. Before striking the agreement, P&G faced the prospect of a shareholder vote at its annual meeting in October on Green Century's call to strengthen its policy on deforestation on a tighter deadline. P&G lawyers argued the measure would ""micromanage"" the company and it ultimately struck the new deal instead. The company cautions that some of its efforts depend on the actions of the Canadian government and new mapping of forests. Green Century two years ago won majority support from shareholders on another resolution calling on P&G to issue a report on how it could beef up its efforts to eliminate deforestation and degradation in its supply chain. P&G's third-largest shareholder, State Street Global Advisors, has also been pressing companies on how they manage risks related to deforestation and says it may withhold votes from board directors and back shareholder proposals on it. Ultimately, P&G's wood pulp purchases represent a ""small portion"" of the 16.8 million metric tons of emissions from its total supply chain, said P&G spokesman Scott Heid. He declined to provide a figure. A widely-used tool called the Paper Calculator, managed by the Environmental Paper Network, however, shows P&G's emissions from wood pulp purchases alone tally 17.8 million metric tons, eclipsing the company's total supply chain emissions. It is a figure the company disputes. P&G pegs consumer use of its products -- such as long showers with Olay body wash -- as accounting for the bulk of its greenhouse gas emissions.

P&G has been under pressure from NRDC and other environmentalists for the last few years to use more recycled materials in its products. P&G declined to comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NRDC wants the SEC, the main U.S. markets regulator, to consider appropriate enforcement action or require P&G to update its statements to investors. P&G said in September that for every tree used, at least two are re-grown, and that it uses satellite monitoring and audits to check on its forest sourcing.

The advocacy group wrote that P&G's claims could be materially misleading to investors because the company sources from pristine forests and from areas that are habitats for caribou. P&G annually purchases more than one million metric tons of wood pulp, which comes from trees, to makes Charmin toilet paper, Bounty paper towels and Puffs tissues. P&G has been under pressure from NRDC and other environmentalists for the last few years to use more recycled materials in its products. P&G declined to comment. The SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NRDC wants the SEC, the main U.S. markets regulator, to consider appropriate enforcement action or require P&G to update its statements to investors. P&G said in September that for every tree used, at least two are re-grown, and that it uses satellite monitoring and audits to check on its forest sourcing. The environmental group also said that P&G's claims are concerning because some investors take into consideration how the company ranks compared to its peers on its environment-related actions. NRDC also said that P&G is overly reliant on third-party certifications for the sustainability of its wood pulp supply chain. NRDC recently encouraged shareholders to vote against CEO Jon Moeller and two directors, Angela Braly and Patricia Woertz, at P&G's annual meeting. The directors and CEO were all voted in last month with more than 90% support.

Less risky nicotine products like heated tobacco sticks were meant to help cigarette companies stay out of court.
In September, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that Philip Morris International and Altria must stop imports of IQOS heated tobacco sticks due to a patent dispute with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, which is owned by U.K.-listed British American Tobacco.

Instead, they are causing a spike in patent lawsuits. In September, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that Philip Morris International and Altria must stop imports of IQOS heated tobacco sticks due to a patent dispute with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, which is owned by U.K.-listed British American Tobacco. The case is now in review and can be appealed. But in the worst-case scenario, IQOS will be banned from the lucrative American tobacco market. This would have less impact on the product's owner PMI than on Altria. The owner of the Marlboro brand in the U.S. has a licensing agreement to distribute IQOS in the country, which could potentially contribute up to 15% of sales by the end of 2023, according to estimates from brokerage Jefferies. Manufacturers are spending more time fighting like this, as the search for cigarette alternatives intensifies. Between 2005 and 2010, patent lawsuits with tobacco firms on both sides of the dispute averaged two a year in the U.S., according to data from analytics firms MaxVal and LexisNexis. These cases usually involved the big firms cracking down on smaller copycats. Since 2015, when the industry sharpened its focus on smokeless products, the annual tally has risen more than 10-fold. Philip Morris and BAT are furthest ahead in their shift to smoke-free technologies, with respective targets to get more than half and one-fifth of net revenue from less harmful products by the middle of the decade. They are also at each other's throats the most. The two have a patent dispute pending in Japan, another key market for smokeless products. And although September's U.S. ruling went in BAT's favor, the maker of Newport cigarettes has recently lost disputes against its rival in Poland, the Czech Republic, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and the U.K. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Can the tobacco industry revamp its image? If so, how? Join the conversation below. One reason why tobacco firms are warring is simply because there is more intellectual property to defend. In the past, tobacco companies may have patented cigarette papers, or their high-speed manufacturing know-how. But e-cigarettes and heated tobacco sticks have more technology in their design than combustible smokes. Philip Morris had 1,300 patents granted as of 2020, for example, up from 170 in 2016. BAT has been the most litigious major tobacco firm in the U.S. over the past five-or-so years, filing 35 patent lawsuits. But it is still far behind PMI in shaking up its portfolio. The company spends Â£350 million a year, equivalent to roughly $480 million, on research and development related to smoke-free productsâ€”around a third less than PMI's annual average since it first began pouring cash into cigarette alternatives in 2008. This is reflected in the two companies' valuations. Shares in Philip Morris trade at 14.5 times projected earnings, double its rival's multiple. Hyperactive patent attorneys can only do so much for BAT's flagging valuation. A more generous innovation budget might be a sounder investment.

The lender sold its stake in BlackRock in May that put an end to longstanding questions about when it would sell the lucrative position.

Employees of Phillips 66 got the message in mid-May. The Houston-based oil refiner couldn't have a viable business if people didn't return to their daily commutes, Chief Executive Greg Garland said in an internal video seen by The Wall Street Journal.
Phillips 66 spokesman Dennis Nuss said the company has continuously updated protocols based on direction from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local guidance and employee feedback, and he didn't dispute Mr. Garland's video message.
Phillips 66 ""understands that some employees have concerns"" and made accommodations for high-risk employees and caregivers of high-risk family members to work from home, Mr. Nuss said.
A document titled ""Frequently Asked Questions"" attached to Mr. Poirier's June 8 email said that with respect to child care, ""It is each employee's responsibility to make sure he or she is able to come back to work when required to do so."" A CrÃ©dit Agricole spokeswoman said the firm has made every effort to protect its employees during the pandemic.
Several other large energy companies in Houston, including Chevron Corp., BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC's U.S. subsidiary Shell Oil Co. and Total SA, have kept most of their employees working remotely throughout the pandemic, with some pulling those who had returned to offices back home as the fourth-largest U.S. city became a coronavirus hot spot.
Phillips 66's Mr. Garland said in the May video that employees had proved they could work remotely, but staying home until a vaccine was available wasn't an option for the economy, the energy industry or the company.
When its office reopened, Phillips 66 didn't require employees to wear masks in several common areas until late June, employees said.
The company also ""rejects any suggestion that Phillips 66 discourages the input of its employees, positive or negative,"" he said.
Since March, Mr. Nuss said, the company's emergency operations center has routinely evaluated and adjusted its plans and protocols based on employee feedback and authorities' guidance.
Employees who live with or are themselves medically vulnerable can seek the company's high-risk designation to work remotely, after submitting documentation from their health-care providers, in line with the Americans With Disabilities Act, Mr. Nuss said.
In internal communication to employees on the company's pandemic pay policy, Phillips 66 said primary caregivers of children attending closed schools or day care would be able to work remotely for an additional workweek to find alternate child care following a business unit's transition back to the office.","Employees of Phillips 66 got the message in mid-May. The Houston-based oil refiner couldn't have a viable business if people didn't return to their daily commutes, Chief Executive Greg Garland said in an internal video seen by The Wall Street Journal. Phillips 66 would have to do its part. ""If we in the energy business are reluctant to go back to the office, why should other people go back? How can we get our economy going again?"" he said in the video. By early June, Phillips 66 had recalled the majority of its employees to its main Houston office, which houses around 2,300 people. It has stayed mostly full as Texas has emerged as a hot spot for new infections that have strained the state's hospital system. Employees at the company have been discussing what they describe as lax safety protocols on issues like masks and an onerous approval process to work from home, according to several people familiar with the conversations. Phillips 66 spokesman Dennis Nuss said the company has continuously updated protocols based on direction from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local guidance and employee feedback, and he didn't dispute Mr. Garland's video message. The company has said its federal designation as critical to U.S. infrastructure exempts it from state rules on workplace capacity. Phillips 66 ""understands that some employees have concerns"" and made accommodations for high-risk employees and caregivers of high-risk family members to work from home, Mr. Nuss said. ""We firmly believe that we have a safe workplace which allows us to continue with an essential business for the nation,"" he said. ""The practices put in place at Phillips 66 demonstrate that it is possible to both reopen many of our businesses while protecting the health and safety of the workforce."" As parts of the U.S. economy attempt to reopen, companies and institutions are taking various approaches to getting people back to work as coronavirus infections surge across the U.S. With more than 3.3 million confirmed cases nationwide and a death toll topping 135,000, employers say they are operating under unprecedented circumstances with no universal guidelines, making it difficult to balance workers' safety and financial exigencies after months of inactivity. The result is a segment of the workforce ranging from baseball players to bankers who say they feel undue pressure to report for duty. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS How should employers respond to workers' concerns about coming back to the office? Join the conversation below. Employees of CrÃ©dit Agricole Group received an email on June 8 from Marc-Andre Poirier, senior regional officer for the Americas at the financial firm's corporate and investment-banking unit, saying that all New York City employees would start returning to the office in phases beginning on June 15. Some would be told to return full-time while others would rotate in and out of the office in assigned groups, according to the email, which was viewed by the Journal. Employees with pre-existing medical conditions were told to contact human resources. One employee who went through the bank's process of asking not to return to the office due to an elevated health risk was told the bank saw no reason for him not to return, according to an email viewed by the Journal. If he decided his health risk prevented him from returning, he was told, he could use vacation days, request unpaid time off or apply for short-term disability leave. ""There's pressure for people to go in,"" said another employee. Aside from health risks, the return process created logistical challenges. Employees who were supposed to return on June 15 were notified days before, leaving parents with little time to arrange for child care. A document titled ""Frequently Asked Questions"" attached to Mr. Poirier's June 8 email said that with respect to child care, ""It is each employee's responsibility to make sure he or she is able to come back to work when required to do so."" A CrÃ©dit Agricole spokeswoman said the firm has made every effort to protect its employees during the pandemic. She said it is closely regulating the number of employees in the office and conducting health screenings by using questionnaires and on-site nurses. She added the firm doesn't comment on the private health of its employees but that it is complying with all laws related to employee health, privacy and safety. Since Phillips 66 began calling workers back to work, Covid-19 cases in its home state have surged. Texas has reported a total 275,058 positive cases as of Tuesday, with about 77% of those emerging since the end of May, according to the state's health department. The state also hit a record in new daily cases Tuesday, with a single-day increase of 10,745, the data show. Several other large energy companies in Houston, including Chevron Corp., BP PLC, Royal Dutch Shell PLC's U.S. subsidiary Shell Oil Co. and Total SA, have kept most of their employees working remotely throughout the pandemic, with some pulling those who had returned to offices back home as the fourth-largest U.S. city became a coronavirus hot spot. Phillips 66's Mr. Garland said in the May video that employees had proved they could work remotely, but staying home until a vaccine was available wasn't an option for the economy, the energy industry or the company. The effects of the pandemic could cost the company $3.2 billion in the first half of the year, he said. In addition, he said limiting workers to teleconferences and video meetings would make it impossible to tap into the creativity and productivity generated by office encounters. The company has had 39 cases of Covid-19 at its Houston headquarters so far, representing less than 2% of the workforce there, according to an internal dashboard viewed by the Journal. Mr. Nuss, the spokesman, said Phillips 66 has monitored, isolated or quarantined employees as necessary. As of July 10, it hadn't seen any evidence of workplace spread ""when employees adhere to our protection practices,"" and contact tracing shows most positive cases result from exposures outside the headquarters office. None of the known cases have resulted in hospitalizations, he said. When its office reopened, Phillips 66 didn't require employees to wear masks in several common areas until late June, employees said. In mid-June, when Harris County ordered businesses to mandate face coverings, the company said in an email viewed by the Journal that the order applied to businesses that provided goods and services directly to the public, which the company doesn't do at its corporate headquarters. When the county raised its coronavirus threat level to the most severe near the end of the month, the company told employees in an email it wouldn't be changing its office staffing levels. It adjusted its policy on masks to require all employees and contractors to wear face coverings in common areas, when people weren't sitting at their desks or in meetings where social distancing was inadequate. Employees said some managers have encouraged workers not to criticize leadership decisions. ""We are unaware of any such instructions or directives by individual managers,"" Mr. Nuss said. The company also ""rejects any suggestion that Phillips 66 discourages the input of its employees, positive or negative,"" he said. Since March, Mr. Nuss said, the company's emergency operations center has routinely evaluated and adjusted its plans and protocols based on employee feedback and authorities' guidance. The company has surveyed employees, who get weekly updates from executives through internal videos, podcasts and virtual meetings. It also has a social-distancing assessment tool, a mobile app for health screening and an email address for employee feedback. Employees who live with or are themselves medically vulnerable can seek the company's high-risk designation to work remotely, after submitting documentation from their health-care providers, in line with the Americans With Disabilities Act, Mr. Nuss said. Many employees who have requested that status were identified and have worked from home, he said. In internal communication to employees on the company's pandemic pay policy, Phillips 66 said primary caregivers of children attending closed schools or day care would be able to work remotely for an additional workweek to find alternate child care following a business unit's transition back to the office. Employees unable to work remotely could take up to one week of paid time off to find alternate child care. Mr. Nuss said company officials are reviewing the policy and ""are mindful of the upcoming school year next month."" Texas education officials said last week they plan for schools to open, with opportunities for some virtual instruction and the expectation that closures could become necessary. Houston's school district said Wednesday that it planned to begin the coming school year with six weeks of remote learning before opening classrooms to students but that its plan could change depending on health officials' guidance.

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced Thursday that it has launched an inquiry into the payment option, which is also known as BNPL. The CFPB asked Affirm Holdings Inc. AFRM, Afterpay Ltd. AFTPYAU:APT, Klarna, PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL and Zip Co. AU:Z1P to provide information that will allow it to â€œreport to the public about industry practices and risksâ€?around BNPL, CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a press release.

The buy-now-pay-later wave:Afterpay, Klarna, Affirm and rivals hope to take U.S. by storm  The CFPB is interested in exploring various issues related to BNPL, including the ability for consumers to accumulate debt and the data-harvesting practices of BNPL operators. â€œThe Bureau would like to better understand practices around data collection, behavioral targeting, data monetization and the risks they may create for consumers,â€?according to the release. An Affirm spokesperson said the company would work with regulators: â€œWe welcome the CFPBâ€™s review and support regulatory efforts that benefit consumers and promote transparency within our industry. For nearly a decade, Affirm has been advancing its mission to deliver honest financial products that improve lives, and we have never charged a late or hidden fee, ever.â€?Affirm Chief Executive Max Levchin said at the companyâ€™s September investor event that he was â€œfairly pro-regulation when it comes to these new financial products,â€?calling attention from regulators â€œpositive so long as it is rooted in understanding of the productâ€?and its intent. A spokeswoman for Afterpay said that the company â€œwelcomes efforts to ensure that there are appropriate regulatory protections for consumers in the diverse BNPL industry, and that providers are meeting high standards and delivering positive consumer outcomes while protecting their data.â€?She also called Afterpayâ€™s offerings more transparent and affordable than traditional credit.

Barclays analyst Ramsey El-Assal wrote that the CFPB inquiry represents â€œprimarily headline risk, for now,â€?noting that the companies are due to submit their responses by March 1, which suggests that, if any regulatory action follows, it wouldnâ€™t take place until later in 2022. â€œAt a high level, we think BNPL is generally superior to revolving credit,â€?El-Assal wrote. Still, he acknowledged that â€œthe industry could face headwinds if providers are required to implement more stringent underwriting standards (thereby rejecting more potential borrowers, though this would be antithetical to the goal of expanding credit access), and report all loans to the credit bureaus, which could result in borrowers not being able to take on multiple loans at once.â€?

From 2018 to 2021 Regions charged roughly $141 million in illegal fees, which will be refunded, the CFPB said in a statement on Wednesday. The bank will also pay a $50 million fine.

The CFPB said regulators have long discouraged banks from charging so-called ""authorized positive"" fees, which are fees a bank charges when a customer has enough funds at the time of a transaction, but ends up overdrawing their account when the transaction clears the following day due to other activity. The agency said the bank could have scrapped the fee earlier, but while building an alternate fee structure, it kept in place ""unintelligible and manipulative processes"" that made it difficult for customers to know if they had enough funds to cover transactions.

This quarter, Coach and Kate Spade's revenue were both led by sales of women's handbags. Compared with mainstream brands, prices are lofty. On the Kate Spade website, bags retail for about $107 to $366, and Coach bags sell for roughly $136 to $1,295. For comparison, a bag from Target (ticker: TGT) may retail for under $30.

Raytheon Technologies,RTX,2020/6/4,"impacts on communities, impacts on landscapes, products (health and environmental issues), health impact","Rare Stock Tweak Pandemic Adds Millions C.E.O.â€™s Potential Payout
Raytheon Technologies, the defense contractor, reset the stock price it would use to calculate certain compensation for its chief and other employees.
The company said the change was necessary to ensure that Mr. Hayes and 3,900 employees â€?about 2 percent of its work force â€?did not lose compensation they had already been awarded.
The stock-related awards that Raytheon amended were part of Mr. Hayesâ€™s compensation when he was chief executive of United Technologies.
Mr. Hayes took over as the chief executive of the combined company, which started trading in April as Raytheon Technologies.
At United Technologies, Mr. Hayesâ€™s total compensation was valued at $21.5 million in 2019, which was 282 times the pay of the companyâ€™s global median employee, who made $76,427, according to a federal filing.
Normally, a rising stock is an unalloyed benefit for executives earning share-based compensation, but because of the intricacies of the United Technologies merger, it left Mr. Hayes and others with less than they hoped to get.
As part of the merger, Raytheon had to recalculate how the United Technologies stock-related awards given to Mr. Hayes and others since 2018 would convert into stock units and appreciation rights issued by the new company.
Because of the change, Mr. Hayesâ€™s unvested appreciation rights rose in value to an estimated $23.8 million from $15.5 million, according to Raytheon.
Raytheon said many other employees had benefited from the change, bolstering their combined stock-based compensation by just over $200 million.","Raytheon Technologies, the defense contractor, reset the stock price it would use to calculate certain compensation for its chief and other employees. Raytheon Technologies, one of the countryâ€™s biggest defense contractors, recently cut salaries for thousands of employees as the pandemic crimped business. Around the same time, it also quietly made a change to the pay package of its chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, that could increase his future income by millions of dollars. Last Friday, after the market closed, Raytheon disclosed in a filing that it had tweaked how it calculates certain stock-related payouts owed to senior executives and employees. The filing did not state by how much Mr. Hayes or others stood to benefit. The change led to an estimated $12.5 million gain for Mr. Hayes on his recent equity awards, Raytheon later told The New York Times. The company said the change was necessary to ensure that Mr. Hayes and 3,900 employees â€?about 2 percent of its work force â€?did not lose compensation they had already been awarded. But some analysts said the change undermined Raytheonâ€™s commitment to use pay to keep executivesâ€?interests in line with those of shareholders. Publicly traded companies have come under pressure to structure stock-related compensation in a way that creates incentives for executives to improve long-term performance and not just seek to enrich themselves in the short term. At Raytheon, â€œshort-term volatility seems to be driving the decision making around these long-term compensation objectives,â€?said Brett Miller, head of data solutions for the responsible-investment arm of Institutional Shareholder Services, a shareholder advisory firm. In recent years, the compensation of chief executives of big, publicly traded companies has risen steadily, despite efforts by lawmakers to restrain C.E.O. pay. The median boss received compensation of $18.6 million in 2018, an increase of 6.3 percent from the previous year, according to a study conducted by Equilar for The Times last year. Ordinary wages of company employees rose far less. The stock-related awards that Raytheon amended were part of Mr. Hayesâ€™s compensation when he was chief executive of United Technologies. In late 2018, United Technologies said it would spin off two units â€?Carrier, a heating and cooling equipment business, and Otis, which makes elevators â€?and last year agreed to merge its remaining aerospace business with Raytheon, which helps make F-35 fighter jets. Mr. Hayes took over as the chief executive of the combined company, which started trading in April as Raytheon Technologies. At United Technologies, Mr. Hayesâ€™s total compensation was valued at $21.5 million in 2019, which was 282 times the pay of the companyâ€™s global median employee, who made $76,427, according to a federal filing. That rate was up from 257 times in 2018. Raytheonâ€™s recent adjustment, which analysts say is rare, reveals the leeway that companies have to shift the goal posts when setting compensation. More than a decade ago, the backdating of stock options at certain companies â€?when executives picked earlier dates for the price at which their options could be exercised, making then more valuable â€?created a corporate scandal and led to penalties. Raytheon representatives say they made the adjustment for the sake of fairness. However, the timing, when a majority of the companyâ€™s work force is being called on to make sacrifices, highlights the different standards that can apply to certain employees and top executives. In addition to pay cuts of 10 percent, Raytheon is furloughing many of its 195,000 employees and cutting billions of dollars in costs, after the pandemic brought global air travel to a near standstill. Mr. Hayes has also volunteered to take a 20 percent pay cut â€?but to his $1.6 million salary, which is a small part of his pay package. Companies use a variety of stock compensation as part of the pay of senior employees, and these so-called equity awards are usually worth far more than the base salary. Mr. Hayesâ€™s compensation at United Technologies included performance and restricted stock units, which typically give the holder the right to get shares after certain operating and stock return targets are met, and stock appreciation rights, which are similar to stock options. If, at the time of vesting, the price of the stock is below the price at which the option or appreciation right is set, those awards are considered to be underwater. That is not expected to happen in Raytheonâ€™s case, because many believe the newly merged defense and aerospace giant will capitalize on its dominant position and do well as the economy recovers. Analysts forecast that earnings at Raytheon will surge 25 percent in 2021 from this yearâ€™s level and that its stock will go up 17 percent. In fact, Raytheonâ€™s stock price jumped 30 percent in the first few days of trading in April. Normally, a rising stock is an unalloyed benefit for executives earning share-based compensation, but because of the intricacies of the United Technologies merger, it left Mr. Hayes and others with less than they hoped to get. As part of the merger, Raytheon had to recalculate how the United Technologies stock-related awards given to Mr. Hayes and others since 2018 would convert into stock units and appreciation rights issued by the new company. To do that, the United Technologies board initially decided it would base a stock price for the conversion on the fourth and fifth days of trading of the new company â€?under the assumption that any volatility associated with a new stock would settle by then. However, the stockâ€™s value jumped from $51 to $64 between the first and fifth days of trading, creating an odd situation. Because the number of stock units and rights to be given out was determined by dividing the last United Technologies stock price by the preselected Raytheon stock price, the jump left recipients with fewer shares than they would have gotten had the company picked the lower price. To remedy that, Raytheon instead switched to the lower $51 price at which the stock started trading, the company said last week. The upshot was that Mr. Hayes and the other employees received additional shares and appreciation rights. When that happens, the holdings of existing shareholders of the company are diluted, which critics say can have the appearance of favoring a small subset of shareholders at the expense of the larger group. Because of the change, Mr. Hayesâ€™s unvested appreciation rights rose in value to an estimated $23.8 million from $15.5 million, according to Raytheon. His unvested stock awards jumped to an estimated value of $20.9 million from $16.7 million. Taken together, the value of his estimated payouts rose $12.5 million. Raytheon said many other employees had benefited from the change, bolstering their combined stock-based compensation by just over $200 million. It said it had made the amendment to reduce some of the losses that employees might otherwise have suffered as a result of the way the post-merger stock conversion worked. â€œThis decision, applied in the same manner across the equity awards of almost 4,000 legacy United Technologies employees, was made to reduce some of the losses that would have otherwise been suffered by dedicated employees whose hard-earned equity is being converted from United Technologies to Raytheon Technologies,â€?a representative for Raytheon said in a written statement. But Carrier and Otis, the two spun-off subsidiaries, decided not to make the change that Raytheon did.","<Incident Category>: impacts on communities, impacts on landscapes, products (health and environmental issues), health impact

I'd left by then, but according to a Washington Post account of the party, his supporters cheered when he denied having made the comment, then gasped when Warren doubled down, ""stunned at the collapse of what they viewed as an unspoken alliance."" For the rest of the night, many ""groaned or even booed"" Warren.
That was enough for his last-minute inclusion in the debate â€?but, as his watch party attendees in Des Moines nodded and cheered politely, they seemed only to reinforce a sense that his momentum was elsewhere.
According to news accounts, when Warren pointed out that the women onstage had won more of their races than the men, applause broke out, followed by chants of ""Warren, Warren."" Supporters of the various presidential hopefuls began filing outside around 10 p.m., after the debate ended.","On Jan. 14, ahead of the Democratic primary debate at Drake University in Des Moines, the Olmsted Center Starbucks on Drake's campus was overrun with figures in green T-shirts â€?not the deep green of the coffee shop logo, but a brighter shade that Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) has claimed for her presidential bid. As of about 5 p.m., the swarm inside Starbucks spilled out of Olmsted, a student hub, and stretched all the way to a rally a few blocks away on a snowy tract of grass. Among the Klobuchar supporters were Richard Jennis, 25, and Cody French, 26, two friends from Excelsior, Minn., who had taken a 31/2-hour bus ride from the Twin Cities to be there. French said he has been active in politics but not in presidential races until now. ""After Trump got elected I figured I couldn't afford to sit on the sidelines anymore,"" he said. Jennis thinks his home-state senator can defeat Trump because she boasts ""a lot of appeal in the states that were essential in the 2016 election ... like Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and other Rust Belt states."" But rather than try to score tickets to be in the debate audience when Klobuchar joined the five other candidates onstage that night, Jennis and French had come for another presidential debate ritual: the official campaign watch party. These gatherings are quasi pep rallies, often with campaign officials or surrogates as guest speakers and some sort of instruction for organizers. And there's always food. Within those parameters, each campaign's shindig is distinct in turnout, makeup, style and demeanor. In Des Moines, watch parties for three of the six candidates took place on separate floors of the Olmsted Center. Klobuchar's campaign took the top floor, the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took the first, and supporters of former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg occupied the basement theater space. Former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and billionaire activist Tom Steyer held their watch parties in another part of town. Warren and Buttigieg's teams soon arrived at Olmsted. But they were far smaller in number than Klobuchar's army of 400. (The campaign had sent three busloads from Minnesota.) Just prior to the start of the debate, a few of Buttigieg's yellow-shirted supporters were still outside, dancing awkwardly to ""High Hopes"" by Panic! at the Disco, which blared from a speaker. Then the front doors swung open and former presidential candidate JuliÃ¡n Castro rushed inside; he was expected at a pre-debate ""strategy session"" for Warren organizers. On my way from the Klobuchar rally to her watch party, I passed an Infowars reporter who was heckling Anderson Cooper as the CNN anchor walked to the auditorium for the debate. After a while, the Infowars guy gave up and disappeared inside the Olmsted Starbucks. Just before 8 p.m., I headed to the Sanders watch party three miles away, across the Des Moines River in the city's East Village, an artsy historic district that BuzzFeed once dubbed ""the closest thing to Brooklyn that Iowa has ever seen."" As we pulled up, my Uber driver noted that Curate, the 6,000-square-foot gallery and event space where the party was taking place, was ""very swank."" It was swank, and packed with a diverse crowd of about 200 that skewed young â€?lots of beards, both kempt and unkempt, and beanies galore. The Domino's pizza was free, but drinks at the bar were not. (Attendees mostly scorned the Bud Light and Michelob for Founders' All Day IPA and Exile, a local brew.) ""I cannot miss a second of this,"" one woman told her friend as the debate got underway. After loud cheers for Sanders, there were groans for Biden when he mentioned his closeness with Barack Obama and defended his vote to invade Iraq. Then came the allegation that Sanders once told Warren a woman couldn't win the presidency. I'd left by then, but according to a Washington Post account of the party, his supporters cheered when he denied having made the comment, then gasped when Warren doubled down, ""stunned at the collapse of what they viewed as an unspoken alliance."" For the rest of the night, many ""groaned or even booed"" Warren. My next stop was Steyer's party in the quiet neighborhood of Beaverdale. The billionaire's gathering was a smaller, humbler affair than the democratic socialist's. About 20 people, mostly white and male, huddled in his Des Moines field office. Barbecue, potato salad and soda bottles sat on blue plastic tablecloths along with paper plates and red Solo cups. In two Iowa polls before the debate, Steyer's support was in the low single digits, while two Fox News polls released Jan. 10 had him at 15 percent in South Carolina and 12 percent in Nevada. That was enough for his last-minute inclusion in the debate â€?but, as his watch party attendees in Des Moines nodded and cheered politely, they seemed only to reinforce a sense that his momentum was elsewhere. Back in the basement of Olmsted, Kasey Springsteen sat among 100 or so Buttigieg supporters, glued to the television. A Drake junior, she recently decided to caucus for the former mayor. ""Not having that national recognition coming into this state can be really hard,"" she said. ""And Iowa-born and -bred, we're not exactly the most accepting to newcomers, but I've just been really impressed with how he's been able to mobilize and inspire."" The debate was winding down as I reached the ground floor, where Warren's faithful occupied an awkwardly shaped space. They looked similar to the Buttigieg supporters in age (most were young) and dress, but they were significantly more diverse. I didn't see anyone boo Sanders. According to news accounts, when Warren pointed out that the women onstage had won more of their races than the men, applause broke out, followed by chants of ""Warren, Warren."" Supporters of the various presidential hopefuls began filing outside around 10 p.m., after the debate ended. (I never made it to Biden's event.) A chill had swept in; the temperature wouldn't break 30 degrees the next day. Some faced a long ride home. Still, no matter how many times they'd seen the candidates squabble over the potential cost of Medicare-for-all or zing one another over impolitic comments and visits to wine caves, these die-hards sounded ready for more.

Starbucks,SBUX,2020/6/12,"discrimination in employment, misleading communication, supply chain issues, racism racial inequality","Taco Bell employee fired supporting Black Lives Matter: company reason? Taco Bell employee fired wearing Black Lives Matter face mask. Starbucks reversed ban Black Lives Matter apparel
Starbucks recently reversed its ban on Black Lives Matter apparel A Taco Bell employee said he was fired after wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask.
A Taco Bell spokesperson told MarketWatch in a statement Thursday that the company had been â€œdisappointedâ€?to learn of the incident â€?and that while its restaurantsâ€?policies donâ€™t prohibit employees from wearing Black Lives Matter masks, it was â€œworking to clarify our mask policy so this doesnâ€™t happen again.â€?â€œWe believe Black Lives Matter,â€?the company said.
Our goal is to ensure our policies are inclusive and keep our team members and customers safe.â€?Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX, US) last Friday reversed an earlier decision to prohibit workers from wearing Black Lives Matter apparel on the job, announcing that the company would be designing a new T-shirt for employees emblazoned with a dozen-plus protest signs, including â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€?and â€œNo justice, no peace.â€?â€œUntil these arrive, weâ€™ve heard you want to show your support, so just be you,â€?company executives wrote in a blog post.
â€œTogether, weâ€™re saying: Black Lives Matter and itâ€™s going to take ALL of us, working together, to affect change.â€?Y-Vonne Hutchinson, the CEO and founder of the diversity and inclusion consulting firm ReadySet, told MarketWatch it was â€œgreat newsâ€?that Starbucks had listened to its employees and customers â€?but added that she thought â€œthis stumble demonstrates the need for deeper change within Starbucks.â€?â€œIt does signal a fundamental lack of understanding around the Black Lives Matter movement, the issues of systemic racism, and Starbucksâ€?role as a popular brand and employer,â€?she said.
â€œI hope they learn from this situation and use it as a catalyst to begin that process of transformation.â€?Employment lawyer Paula Brantner, the principal and president of PB Work Solutions, said Starbucksâ€?move was â€œvery responsive to both the moment and what their partners want their company to stand for.â€?â€œThe statement is consistent with the Starbucks brand and what I understand of their culture, which shows that companies should be prepared to listen to what their employees want and not just impose the views of corporate management or restrictive rules that will cause employees to chafe or speak out publicly in opposition,â€?she said.
The policy change came after backlash to a BuzzFeed News report about an internal company memo that advised Black Lives Matter clothing and accessories did not adhere to Starbucksâ€?dress code policy â€?and explained that â€œagitators who misconstrue the fundamental principles of Black Lives Matter movementâ€?might â€œintentionally repurpose them to amplify divisiveness.â€?The companyâ€™s dress code prohibits any button or pin that â€œinterferes with safety or threatens to harm customer relations or otherwise unreasonably interferes with Starbucks public image,â€?as well as pins or buttons â€œthat advocate a political, religious or personal issue,â€?the memo said.
But companies are fairly susceptible in the court of public opinion to being called out for this kind of behavior, she added, â€œso thatâ€™s probably the way to go at the moment.â€?â€˜This country is going through a major changeâ€?Starbucks baristas arenâ€™t the only public-facing employees who have struggled to express support for the Black Lives Matter movement at work.
Quinton Desamours, an 18-year-old from Lehigh Acres, Fla., says he resigned from his Publix supermarket job this month after an assistant manager asked him at the beginning of his shift June 6 to remove a face mask bearing the acronym â€œBLM.â€?The manager said that he didnâ€™t personally have a problem with the mask, Desamours told MarketWatch, but added that he wasnâ€™t yet sure where the company stood on the issue â€?a statement Desamours said he found â€œdisturbing.â€?The teen said the manager also told him he was endangering himself and others who worked there, and said Desamours couldnâ€™t go back to work with the mask on.
A spokeswoman told the South Bend Tribune that the company stood in support of racial equality, and that â€œrespect is one of our core values, and as such, all of our associates have the responsibility to create a supportive and welcoming environment that values every individual.â€?Dennis Eidson, the interim president and CEO of Martinâ€™s parent SpartanNash, recently called on Americans to â€œstep up and do more to eradicate racism,â€?and said the company would continue providing workers with opportunities to complete â€œdignity and respect training and unconscious bias training.â€?Support for Black Lives Matter has grown in recent weeks Surveys show a dramatic increase in Americansâ€?support for the Black Lives Matter movement over time.
â€œItâ€™s an absolute statement â€?black lives matter â€?so I think that is whatâ€™s being said,â€?Roberson added.
Thatâ€™s the kind of systemic change that seems to be happening, but I think itâ€™s going to take time to see how real it is.â€?That change, she added, includes supporting employees who choose to publicly support Black Lives Matter at work.
â€œWhen a company comes out and talks about the tragic events and how they support their black employees and theyâ€™re investing in communities â€?if there are incidents within the company that donâ€™t match that, I think thatâ€™s where companies are going to be the most vulnerable right now.â€?â€˜They just have to put some muscle behind that decisionâ€?Hutchinson doesnâ€™t buy arguments that policies governing employeesâ€?Black Lives Matter attire are meant to keep workers safe.
â€œIf you have someone whoâ€™s  and who doesnâ€™t have that kind of support, thatâ€™s when it gets dangerous.â€?Hutchinson said it wasnâ€™t on black employees â€?â€œwho in many cases are bearing the brunt of this systemic, institutional racism,â€?and often have less power at work â€?to lead the charge for changing the rules.","A Taco Bell employee said he was fired after wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask. Starbucks recently reversed its ban on Black Lives Matter apparel A Taco Bell employee said he was fired after wearing a Black Lives Matter face mask. Starbucks recently reversed its ban on Black Lives Matter apparel As support for the Black Lives Matter movement grows, companies with a public commitment to racial justice are grappling with how to address the matter internally â€?and some employees are speaking out. Denzel Skinner, a former Taco Bell (YUM, US) shift manager in Youngstown, Ohio, said in a June 8 Facebook Live (FB, US) video that his manager had fired him after he refused to remove a Black Lives Matter mask at work. Protesters later marched in support of Skinner, according to local news accounts, and a clip from his account of the incident went viral on Twitter(TWTR, US) Thursday. â€œIf the governor and governments are requiring us to wear masks, we should be able to wear any type of mask that you want,â€?Skinner told local NBC affiliate WFMJ. â€œAnd not only that, I still want everyone to believe that we still need justice for what is happening in this world and people need to be held accountable for whatever mistakes that they make. Black lives are going to always matter. Not just when some people want it to matter. It will always matter.â€?The hashtag #RIPTacoBell trended on Twitter on Thursday as users called for a boycott over the firing. A Taco Bell spokesperson told MarketWatch in a statement Thursday that the company had been â€œdisappointedâ€?to learn of the incident â€?and that while its restaurantsâ€?policies donâ€™t prohibit employees from wearing Black Lives Matter masks, it was â€œworking to clarify our mask policy so this doesnâ€™t happen again.â€?â€œWe believe Black Lives Matter,â€?the company said. â€œWe take this very seriously; we have been working closely with our franchisee that operates this location to address the issue. Our Chief People Officer and Yum!â€™s Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer spoke with Denzel last week to apologize and discuss the situation. Our goal is to ensure our policies are inclusive and keep our team members and customers safe.â€?Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX, US) last Friday reversed an earlier decision to prohibit workers from wearing Black Lives Matter apparel on the job, announcing that the company would be designing a new T-shirt for employees emblazoned with a dozen-plus protest signs, including â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€?and â€œNo justice, no peace.â€?â€œUntil these arrive, weâ€™ve heard you want to show your support, so just be you,â€?company executives wrote in a blog post. â€œWear your BLM pin or t-shirt. We are so proud of your passionate support of our common humanity.â€?The employee-led Starbucks Black Partner Network and allies created the shirt â€œto recognize the historic significance of this time,â€?they added. â€œTogether, weâ€™re saying: Black Lives Matter and itâ€™s going to take ALL of us, working together, to affect change.â€?Y-Vonne Hutchinson, the CEO and founder of the diversity and inclusion consulting firm ReadySet, told MarketWatch it was â€œgreat newsâ€?that Starbucks had listened to its employees and customers â€?but added that she thought â€œthis stumble demonstrates the need for deeper change within Starbucks.â€?â€œIt does signal a fundamental lack of understanding around the Black Lives Matter movement, the issues of systemic racism, and Starbucksâ€?role as a popular brand and employer,â€?she said. â€œI hope they learn from this situation and use it as a catalyst to begin that process of transformation.â€?Employment lawyer Paula Brantner, the principal and president of PB Work Solutions, said Starbucksâ€?move was â€œvery responsive to both the moment and what their partners want their company to stand for.â€?â€œThe statement is consistent with the Starbucks brand and what I understand of their culture, which shows that companies should be prepared to listen to what their employees want and not just impose the views of corporate management or restrictive rules that will cause employees to chafe or speak out publicly in opposition,â€?she said.

Some Starbucks workers who spoke with BuzzFeed called the companyâ€™s initial decision â€œsurprising and disappointingâ€?â€?particularly given Starbucksâ€?public support for racial-equity causes â€?and said it made their voices feel â€œmuted,â€?pointing out that the company had allowed accessories and shirts that celebrate LGBTQ rights. The ban spawned a #BoycottStarbucks hashtag that went viral. A Starbucks spokesperson told MarketWatch on Thursday that the company was â€œcommitted to doing our part in ending systemic racism.â€?Companies can have dress codes, but they canâ€™t be discriminatory Thereâ€™s no federal law, and there are only a handful of state laws, â€œthat potentially protect an employeeâ€™s right to speak out at work about an important social issue,â€?Brantner said. And while companies are allowed to have dress codes, theyâ€™re not allowed to enforce them in racially discriminatory ways, she added. â€œOf course, that would be against the law if a black employee was fired for wearing  but a non-black employee was not terminated for wearing something similar,â€?such as an â€œAll Lives Matterâ€?shirt, she said. The nonprofit employee-rights organization Workplace Fairness, which Brantner previously advised and led, notes that â€œdress code policies must target all employees, not just you.â€?â€œWhile employers have a fair amount of latitude in enforcing dress code provisions, if you feel that your privacy rights have been violated by your employer or believe the enforcement of the dress code is discriminatory, contact your state department of labor, or a private attorney for more information,â€?the organization says. There might not be a legal remedy in cases that donâ€™t show clear-cut discrimination, Brantner said. But companies are fairly susceptible in the court of public opinion to being called out for this kind of behavior, she added, â€œso thatâ€™s probably the way to go at the moment.â€?â€˜This country is going through a major changeâ€?Starbucks baristas arenâ€™t the only public-facing employees who have struggled to express support for the Black Lives Matter movement at work. Quinton Desamours, an 18-year-old from Lehigh Acres, Fla., says he resigned from his Publix supermarket job this month after an assistant manager asked him at the beginning of his shift June 6 to remove a face mask bearing the acronym â€œBLM.â€?The manager said that he didnâ€™t personally have a problem with the mask, Desamours told MarketWatch, but added that he wasnâ€™t yet sure where the company stood on the issue â€?a statement Desamours said he found â€œdisturbing.â€?The teen said the manager also told him he was endangering himself and others who worked there, and said Desamours couldnâ€™t go back to work with the mask on. â€œBut that was my mask, so I decided to leave,â€?he said. While the supermarket chain does prohibit masks with â€œnon-Publix messaging,â€?Desamours claims that rule wasnâ€™t strictly enforced at his store, citing coworkersâ€?masks displaying a floral design and a comic strip. He later called to resign from his employer of a month and a half. A district manager called a few days later to apologize and offer his position back, he said, saying that his resignation hadnâ€™t gone through yet. But Desamours said he no longer wanted to work there. â€œThis country is going through a major change, and I didnâ€™t want to be a part of a company that doesnâ€™t want to be a part of the change,â€?he said. â€œI know how people try to twist  into a political statement, but the basis of the movement is equality, and thatâ€™s how I saw it â€?and thatâ€™s what I told them.â€?Publix did not return a MarketWatch request for comment on Desamoursâ€?account. But in response to an inquiry about a similar incident, a message posted on Publixâ€™s customer-service Twitter account Friday said: â€œWe have ordered a substantial number of face coverings to provide to our associates as part of our mandatory facial covering policy. Given the impact demand has had on availability, we have allowed associates to wear medical/surgical masks, dust masks and cloth face coverings until their uniform face coverings arrive in the coming days. Our uniform policy does not permit non-Publix messaging.â€?â€œOur focus remains on ensuring a welcoming work and shopping environment for all associates and customers,â€?the company added, linking to a page that noted Publixâ€™s $1 million donation to National Urban League affiliates alongside CEO Todd Jonesâ€™s note to associates about racial injustice and diversity. In a similar incident on June 5, a Martinâ€™s Super Market employee in Granger, Ind., said he quit his job after allegedly being told he couldnâ€™t wear the â€œBlack Lives Matterâ€?mask he had worn during two of his shifts. â€œToday I was informed by my store manager that there had been so many customer complaints filed against me for wearing it that the corporate office was instructing me not to wear it. Meanwhile, Martins has made no statement in solidarity of its black workers or customers,â€?Avery Worrell wrote in a Facebook post. â€œSome may say I was violating company policy for using them as a â€˜platform,â€™â€?he added, â€œbut I believe Martinâ€™s should speak out and actively combat racism especially because they serve a largely white consumer base and these tend to be the people who need to hear it the most.â€?Martinâ€™s did not return a MarketWatch request for comment. A spokeswoman told the South Bend Tribune that the company stood in support of racial equality, and that â€œrespect is one of our core values, and as such, all of our associates have the responsibility to create a supportive and welcoming environment that values every individual.â€?Dennis Eidson, the interim president and CEO of Martinâ€™s parent SpartanNash, recently called on Americans to â€œstep up and do more to eradicate racism,â€?and said the company would continue providing workers with opportunities to complete â€œdignity and respect training and unconscious bias training.â€?Support for Black Lives Matter has grown in recent weeks Surveys show a dramatic increase in Americansâ€?support for the Black Lives Matter movement over time. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll this month, for example, found that 57% of U.S. adults had a â€œvery or somewhat favorableâ€?view of the movement. In contrast, just 27% of U.S. adults in a 2016 YouGov poll said they â€œstrongly or somewhatâ€?approved of the movement. The recent protests stemming from George Floydâ€™s killing appear to have galvanized considerable support for Black Lives Matter: A June 10 New York Times article, citing data from the survey-research firm Civiqs, reported that support for the movement had grown in the previous two weeks by almost as much as it had in the last two years. â€œIt seems that more people in the public are endorsing and making the statement that black lives matter rather than saying, â€˜Iâ€™m part of a movement or part of an organizationâ€?or any kind of connotation that goes with that,â€?Quinetta Roberson, a Villanova University professor of management who specializes in diversity and inclusion, told MarketWatch. â€œItâ€™s an absolute statement â€?black lives matter â€?so I think that is whatâ€™s being said,â€?Roberson added. â€œOnce it starts getting into interpretation and more relative and more evaluative, thatâ€™s where we start to see the controversy.â€?Those three words have become â€œmore mainstream,â€?Brantner said. â€œPeople are pushing back on the perception of Black Lives Matter as a radical or violent movement, and not letting its identity be smeared by those who are uncomfortable with what it represents,â€?she said. Brands, meanwhile, are cognizant of â€œthe power of social-justice messaging,â€?Hutchinson said. She pointed to Nikeâ€™s (NKE, US) soaring sales after the company backed ex-NFL player Colin Kaepernick in his protest against racial injustice and police brutality. â€œMarketers and brand managers are paying attention to that, so the messaging has on the corporate side changed,â€?she said. â€œI still donâ€™t know what that means for real corporate practices in terms of where the rubber meets the road: Are businesses hiring, promoting, supporting their black employees? Are they respecting their black customers? Thatâ€™s the kind of systemic change that seems to be happening, but I think itâ€™s going to take time to see how real it is.â€?That change, she added, includes supporting employees who choose to publicly support Black Lives Matter at work. â€œTheyâ€™ve made their statements, theyâ€™ve contributed money or tried to put in support systems,â€?Roberson agreed. â€œBut whatâ€™s the next thing? How do they start to actually change the culture or the structure of their organizations so that these things get addressed in a sustainable way?â€?Companies will have to answer for when their treatment of employees is at odds with the public image theyâ€™ve cultivated, Brantner said. â€œWhen a company comes out and talks about the tragic events and how they support their black employees and theyâ€™re investing in communities â€?if there are incidents within the company that donâ€™t match that, I think thatâ€™s where companies are going to be the most vulnerable right now.â€?â€˜They just have to put some muscle behind that decisionâ€?Hutchinson doesnâ€™t buy arguments that policies governing employeesâ€?Black Lives Matter attire are meant to keep workers safe. Store managers and employees should be comfortable calling the authorities or booting customers who harass their coworkers, she said. â€œTheyâ€™re not obligated to serve the person who doesnâ€™t align with their values or who doesnâ€™t treat their employees well â€?they just have to put some muscle behind that decision,â€?she said. â€œIf you have someone whoâ€™s  and who doesnâ€™t have that kind of support, thatâ€™s when it gets dangerous.â€?Hutchinson said it wasnâ€™t on black employees â€?â€œwho in many cases are bearing the brunt of this systemic, institutional racism,â€?and often have less power at work â€?to lead the charge for changing the rules. Thatâ€™s a job for workers with privilege, she said, who can leverage their power as allies. Desamours, who is headed to ASA College in Miami to play basketball in the fall, said he was in a financially stable place that made his resignation possible. But he acknowledged that many others are not in the same position. â€œI know a lot of people may put up with discrimination or racism or inequality at work, but they have to stay â€?they need to do what they have to do to pay their bills,â€?he said. â€œIâ€™m glad I was able to take a stand and be a voice for people who canâ€™t always do that.â€?

But, others questioned if the company could be doing more. Multiple petitions are circulating online to raise Starbucks' pay, including one demanding $15 starting pay for all employees. Max, a Starbucks worker in Chicago, was one of the more than 8,800 to sign the petition. A few weeks after signing, Max said, Starbucks alerted employees about the raises. ""I think it's Starbucks reacting to social media and not actually listening to the people until a petition blows up,"" Max told Business Insider. (Business Insider agreed to only use Max's first name to allow the employee to speak freely about the situation.) The pay increase follows significant investments Starbucks has made around worker safety during the pandemic. In late March, the company announced it would be paying employees to stay home if they felt unsafe working during the pandemic. The company is allowing employees to take an unpaid leave of absence through March 2021, while keeping existing benefits. Still, Starbucks workers continue to face challenges during the pandemic. Employees say they are facing harassment from anti-mask customers, as well as stress-related to working as COVID cases surge. ""If we're labeled as essential workers, we should get paid essential,"" said Jay Josef, who has worked at Starbucks for nine years. ""That's why  a $15 minimum wage increase."" Minimum wage hikes could hit Starbucks hard With President-election Joe Biden's victory over President Donald Trump, the question of how much workers should be paid is a hot topic in the restaurant business. Biden has said it is necessary to raise the federal minimum wage to $15, which would boost how much many low-wage restaurant workers make. ""One other thing that people may not realize is we've raised the minimum wage in weak economies in the past,"" Jared Bernstein, an outside economic advisor to Biden and formerly a top aide during his vice presidency, told Business Insider in October. ""The results have been the same."" The likelihood of a $15 minimum wage passing under Biden declined after Republicans won several key Senate seats, leaving the government divided. However, with more states passing regulation to increase minimum wages, the topic remains top of mind for many restaurant executives. In the past, the restaurant industry has fought hard against raising the minimum wage. However, recently, some fast-food giants have relaxed their opposition. McDonald's, for example, stopped lobbying against minimum wage increases last year. ""We've been pretty clear for a while now that we are not against a conversation about the minimum wage,"" McDonald's CEO Chris Kempczinski said in an interview with CNBC. ""We work in 120 markets around the world with wage rates all over the place, from over $20 to less than that."" Starbucks' bottom line could suffer more than McDonald's or Dunkin's if all workers start making $15. In late October, Stifel analyst Chris O'Cull said in a report that Starbucks, along with Chipotle and Shake Shack, are among the three restaurant stocks that could be most impacted by a $15 minimum wage. According to O'Cull, Starbucks would be hit hard by minimum wage hikes because it is not a franchise. Roughly 9,600 of the chains' locations in the US are owned by the company, about half of total Starbucks locations across America. As a result, higher pay would cut into the company's bottom line instead of being covered by franchisees, who own and operate most locations of fast-food chains in the US. Further, O'Cull wrote, sit-down chains are more likely to have workers that already make over minimum wage or are in tipped positions (which would not be impacted by the same regulation).

Starbucks,SBUX,2021/6/1,tax optimization,"Starbucks, Flush Customers, Running Ingredients
â€œItâ€™s surprising because Starbucks always seems like it has anything and everything you need.â€?Across the country, customers and baristas are taking to social media to bemoan not only shortages of key ingredients for popular Starbucks drinks, like peach and guava juices, but also a lack of iced and cold-brew coffee, breakfast foods and cake pops, and even cups, lids and straws.
A video on TikTok this week featured what appeared to be a group of employees screaming in frustration over a list of ingredients that the shop had run out of â€?including sweet cream, white mocha, mango dragon fruit and â€œevery food item.â€?The caption also said they were low on cold brew and the â€œwill to live.â€?Starbucks is hardly the only company struggling with supply issues.
She said the shortages varied by location, with some stores experiencing â€œoutages of various items at the same time.â€?She added that the company was working with its vendors to restock the items as soon as possible, and that the supply-chain issues had not affected prices.
Although most people are familiar with the problems in the global supply chain to some extent, some Starbucks customers are still shocked â€?even incensed â€?by their inability to get their coffee exactly how they want it.
Orders are not barked out by number as they are at other fast-food chains but rather are announced by name, suggesting customers are friends or part of the Starbucks club, said Bryant Simon, a history professor at Temple University and author of â€œEverything but the Coffee: Learning About America From Starbucks.â€?â€œStarbucks did something remarkable: taking a really ordinary product, coffee, and remaking it as an identifier of class, of culture, of discernment and of knowledge,â€?Mr. Simon said.
â€œI do anticipate weâ€™ll do a little more to invest and help our supply chain partners, whether itâ€™s staff that they need in manufacturing or staffing that they need for distribution and transportation,â€?Mr. Johnson said.
â€œBut this was 6:45 in the morning.â€?Customers may be unhappy, but Mr. Simon said the paucity of drinks or food items would likely only increase demand.
â€œIâ€™m sure there are a lot of heated conversations in Seattle right now about the supply-chain issues, but someone on the branding side is going to be chirping in that the scarcity may not be a bad thing,â€?Mr. Simon said.","At locations across the country, there have been complaints about shortages of key ingredients for popular drinks, breakfast foods and even cups, lids and straws. Tasha Leverette was in the mood for her favorite drink from Starbucks, an iced peach green-tea lemonade. When she went through the drive-through of her usual Starbucks in Atlanta three weeks ago, though, she was told they couldnâ€™t make the drink because they didnâ€™t have any peach-flavored juice. Shrugging it off, she drove to another store. And another. And another. Each stop brought disappointment. None of the locations had the integral ingredient. â€œI said to them, â€˜This is the Peach State, right?â€™â€?said Ms. Leverette, 33, who owns a public relations firm. â€œItâ€™s surprising because Starbucks always seems like it has anything and everything you need.â€?Across the country, customers and baristas are taking to social media to bemoan not only shortages of key ingredients for popular Starbucks drinks, like peach and guava juices, but also a lack of iced and cold-brew coffee, breakfast foods and cake pops, and even cups, lids and straws. A video on TikTok this week featured what appeared to be a group of employees screaming in frustration over a list of ingredients that the shop had run out of â€?including sweet cream, white mocha, mango dragon fruit and â€œevery food item.â€?The caption also said they were low on cold brew and the â€œwill to live.â€?Starbucks is hardly the only company struggling with supply issues. Earlier this spring, ketchup packets became hotter than GameStop stock. Automakers have slowed production because there are not enough computer chips for their vehicles. And homeowners are waiting weeks, if not months, for major kitchen appliances. But Starbucks is running out of ingredients for Very Berry Hibiscus Refreshers and almond croissants after being one of the clear winners of the pandemic economy. During lockdowns, the coffee chain quickly shifted from its position as a â€œthird place,â€?where people could linger to work or meet up for long chats, to a focus on frictionless transactions with customers ordering through mobile apps and drive-throughs. Company executives said this year that Starbucks had seen a â€œfull recoveryâ€?in sales in the United States, back to prepandemic levels. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Starbucks said the company was experiencing â€œtemporary supply shortagesâ€?of some of its products. She said the shortages varied by location, with some stores experiencing â€œoutages of various items at the same time.â€?She added that the company was working with its vendors to restock the items as soon as possible, and that the supply-chain issues had not affected prices. Although most people are familiar with the problems in the global supply chain to some extent, some Starbucks customers are still shocked â€?even incensed â€?by their inability to get their coffee exactly how they want it. Others laugh it off. â€œI was told they couldnâ€™t give me an extra shot of caramel because there was a national shortage,â€?Nicole Brashear, a 24-year-old pharmacy student at the University of Louisiana at Monroe, said of ordering an iced caramel macchiato with extra caramel drizzle in late May. â€œI just sort of laughed and was like, â€˜Isnâ€™t caramel just burnt sugar?â€™â€?The problem for Starbucks is that it was never just selling a simple cup of coffee. For many, the experience of visiting the chain is a self-indulgent treat. Customers learn the language regarding sizes and special drinks and then share their customized, 12-ingredient drink orders on social media. Many look forward to seasonal specials, like this summerâ€™s Unicorn Cake Pop and Strawberry Funnel Cake Frappuccino, which are available for a limited time. Orders are not barked out by number as they are at other fast-food chains but rather are announced by name, suggesting customers are friends or part of the Starbucks club, said Bryant Simon, a history professor at Temple University and author of â€œEverything but the Coffee: Learning About America From Starbucks.â€?â€œStarbucks did something remarkable: taking a really ordinary product, coffee, and remaking it as an identifier of class, of culture, of discernment and of knowledge,â€?Mr. Simon said. â€œStarbucks is a way to communicate something about yourself to other people. While it has become more complicated over time, that drink still says: â€˜I deserve a break in my life. I can afford to waste money on coffee.â€™â€?There were earlier hints that supply issues could be bubbling up for Starbucks. In a late April call with Wall Street analysts, the chief executive of Starbucks, Kevin Johnson, voiced some concerns about companies in its supply chain that were struggling to hire the staff they needed. â€œI do anticipate weâ€™ll do a little more to invest and help our supply chain partners, whether itâ€™s staff that they need in manufacturing or staffing that they need for distribution and transportation,â€?Mr. Johnson said. By late May, customers and baristas were reporting shortages of key ingredients or foods in stores all over the country. Fred Rogers knew something was wrong right before Memorial Day weekend when he opened his Starbucks app and an alert flashed that the company was experiencing shortages of certain items. He wasnâ€™t able to order his 3-year-old daughter her favorite sandwich â€?sausage, Cheddar and egg â€?from his nearby Starbucks in Burlington, N.J. His drink, a Caramel Ribbon Crunch Frappuccino, was also not available. â€œI know if you go after a certain hour that theyâ€™re going to be out of some items,â€?said Mr. Rogers, a 33-year-old manufacturing specialist. â€œBut this was 6:45 in the morning.â€?Customers may be unhappy, but Mr. Simon said the paucity of drinks or food items would likely only increase demand. One of Starbucksâ€™s biggest challenges in recent years has been overexpansion, meaning it has shed some of the uniqueness that once made it special. â€œIâ€™m sure there are a lot of heated conversations in Seattle right now about the supply-chain issues, but someone on the branding side is going to be chirping in that the scarcity may not be a bad thing,â€?Mr. Simon said. Perhaps, but the issues could also be a risk if customers become too frustrated over not being able to get what they want, as they always have. When his daughter couldnâ€™t get her favorite breakfast sandwich at Starbucks, Mr. Rogers took her to a nearby Chick-fil-A for breakfast. And after driving to four different Starbucks and not getting her favorite drink in late May, Ms. Leverette is no longer a regular customer. â€œItâ€™s disappointing,â€?she said. â€œYou go, and youâ€™re waiting in the drive-through, and youâ€™re only going for one thing and they donâ€™t have what they need to make it. â€œI just stopped even bothering to go.â€?

Starbucks,SBUX,2022/10/14,"freedom of association and collective bargaining, poor employment conditions, salaries and benefits","Labor movement's big challenge: Keeping momentum economy slows
It has been a year of firsts for the U.S. labor movement, with successful votes for unions' first Amazon warehouse, first Apple Store and first Trader Joe's, Chipotle and REI locations.
The labor movement has continued to gain traction this fall, despite a high-profile union defeat last week at an Amazon warehouse near Albany, N.Y. With 21 months of strong job gains, the tight labor market has resulted in unusual worker shortages across many sectors over the past year, giving workers more leverage with employers.
The challenges for labor go beyond a softening of the labor market, as companies such as Amazon and Starbucks have had success fighting off union efforts through sophisticated anti-union campaigns.
While Amazon has been a hard nut for unions to crack, with just one union victory at a Staten Island warehouse in April, organized labor has made inroads throughout the retail and service sector.
Ruth Milkman, a sociologist of labor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said that the upsurge in union interest among young, college-educated people has been taking shape quietly for years â€?particularly in media and higher education â€?but it's only recently captured national attention because of high-profile efforts at companies such as Starbucks.
Workers tend to be more emboldened to unionize during periods of low unemployment and high job availability, she said.

Amazon Labor Union filed last week for its first union election on the West Coast, at a warehouse in Moreno Valley, Calif.
Home Depot's Philadelphia workers want the company to address deteriorating working conditions caused by labor shortages and understaffing, according to Vince Quiles, 27, a leader of the Home Depot unionization effort in Philadelphia.","It has been a year of firsts for the U.S. labor movement, with successful votes for unions' first Amazon warehouse, first Apple Store and first Trader Joe's, Chipotle and REI locations. The most promising of all for union organizers has been victories at some 250 Starbucks stores. The labor movement has continued to gain traction this fall, despite a high-profile union defeat last week at an Amazon warehouse near Albany, N.Y. With 21 months of strong job gains, the tight labor market has resulted in unusual worker shortages across many sectors over the past year, giving workers more leverage with employers. ""There's a combination of things that have contributed to this organizing wave that we're seeing, and the pandemic and post-pandemic economy have been a large part of that,"" said John Logan, a labor studies professor at San Francisco State University. ""It has opened up an opportunity for unions that didn't exist before the pandemic."" There are other objective measures of increased enthusiasm for unions this year. The National Labor Relations Board reported a 53 percent year-over-year increase in union election petitions over the past 12 months. Meanwhile, 71 percent of Americans say they approve of labor unions, according to Gallup, the highest support in the annual poll since 1965. ""In a time where most institutions, including the Supreme Court, are becoming less and less popular or trusted, unions have their highest level of popularity in decades,"" said David Weil, the Labor Department's top wage and hour regulator under President Barack Obama. ""We certainly see a restiveness that is coming out of the pandemic. There's a greater willingness of working people to show dissatisfaction."" However, as the economy teeters toward a downturn in coming months, the window for cementing more victories could be narrowing. Already job openings have fallen, and some companies â€?particularly in technology and interest-rate sensitive sectors such as mortgage finance â€?have ordered hiring freezes and layoffs, igniting fears that the paradigm of power in favor of workers could be short-lived. ""Workers have a lot of bargaining power, and that is fueling a resurgence in the labor movement,"" said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. ""Unions are trying to make real lasting inroads during this period. That's going to change in 2023 and almost by definition lead to a reduction in worker bargaining power."" For now, momentum appears to be accelerating in certain sectors, with walkouts at Amazon warehouses last week in Atlanta; Joliet, Ill.; and San Bernardino, Calif. A Home Depot in Philadelphia could become the company's first location to unionize next month, and workers at a Trader Joe's in New York City will vote on whether to make it the company's first union store in that particular region. Quality assurance testers at Blizzard Albany, a subsidiary of games giant Activision Blizzard, will vote on whether to join a union. The country may also get its only unionized strip club in November. Labor organizing efforts have also sprung up at Lowe's, T-Mobile and Geico. It is not clear whether these developments will increase union worker numbers. Last year, despite polls showing elevated enthusiasm for organized labor, union membership in the United States fell from 10.8 percent in 2020 to 10.3 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The challenges for labor go beyond a softening of the labor market, as companies such as Amazon and Starbucks have had success fighting off union efforts through sophisticated anti-union campaigns. While Amazon has been a hard nut for unions to crack, with just one union victory at a Staten Island warehouse in April, organized labor has made inroads throughout the retail and service sector. There have been multiple union election successes at Starbucks, Apple, REI and Trader Joe's this year. Labor experts say those retailers' workforces are easier to unionize because their workplaces are smaller and less physically spread out than Amazon's. Employees at unionized stores also tend to be younger, more educated and left-leaning politically, experts said. Ruth Milkman, a sociologist of labor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, said that the upsurge in union interest among young, college-educated people has been taking shape quietly for years â€?particularly in media and higher education â€?but it's only recently captured national attention because of high-profile efforts at companies such as Starbucks. Those workers are in jobs ""that are inferior to those they expected or aspired to get,"" Milkman said. ""It's true that the scale is modest. Nevertheless, it's highly significant and highly unprecedented."" Union obstaclesA number of hurdles that may unfold in coming months could snuff out momentum for unions. For example, if Republicans do well in next month's elections, organized labor could face a less favorable environment. Tennessee has a GOP-backed ballot measure that would enshrine in the state constitution a ""right-to-work"" law that exempts workers from paying dues for union representation. Such measures typically correspond with declines in union membership. Even more significantly, most economists agree that the economy is in the waning days of a tight labor market. Every week, more economists predict a recession in 2023, as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to control inflation by slowing the economy. When employers have more power, it is easier for them to retaliate against staffers who try to organize, said Heidi Shierholz, president of the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank in Washington. Workers tend to be more emboldened to unionize during periods of low unemployment and high job availability, she said. ""The consequences of taking the risk to unionize are lower if lots of jobs are available,"" Shierholz said. Recessions and other economic downturns have often corresponded with declines in union activity and popularity â€?with a few important exceptions, such as the Great Depression. For example, the approval rating of unions in the United States dropped to its lowest point in 2009, during the height of unemployment following the Great Recession. In the 1980s, aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led to a period of prolonged high unemployment, contributing to a dramatic reduction in union membership in the United States. Labor and employment experts are hopeful that a non-catastrophic economic downturn would not decrease enthusiasm for labor activism and the willingness of workers to demand more. Weil, the Obama-era labor official, said that although previous historical downturns have resulted in less union activity, the current era of labor relations differs from the periods coming out of the Great Recession of 2008 and dot-com bubble of the early 2000s. ""On either side of those recessions, we didn't see the kind of upsurge in labor activity we're seeing now,"" Weil said. However, a full-fledged recession could lead to a drop in union efforts, they acknowledge. ""If the economy really tanks, that's a different story,"" said Thomas Kochan, a professor of industrial relations at the MIT Sloan School of Management. ""Everyone will get really concerned about job security."" Ongoing labor efforts The Amazon Labor Union lost a high-stakes union election near Albany on Tuesday, in a decisive 406-206 defeat. Despite this defeat, workers seeking to unionize Amazon warehouses say they are undeterred. They accuse Amazon of engaging in an anti-union campaign that prevented a ""free and fair"" election. Union leaders said they were deterred from organizing in company break rooms during the campaign, a tactic that was crucial to the union's historic Staten Island victory in April. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post. ""We're glad that our team in Albany was able to have their voices heard, and that they chose to keep the direct relationship with Amazon, as we think that this is the best arrangement for both our employees and customers,"" said Kelly Nantel, an Amazon spokeswoman. The National Labor Relations Board is investigating 27 unfair labor practice charges that the union has filed against the Amazon warehouse near Albany. A recent charge alleges that Amazon suspended a worker after he complained about being harassed during the election by anti-union consultants Amazon had hired. The independent union has faced growing pains as it has tried to expand beyond its initial victory in Staten Island without substantial funding, or the staff and legal resources of an established national labor union. The union, which says it has about several hundred thousand dollars in its budget, is still battling Amazon for certification and a contract at the 8,300-worker Staten Island warehouse. Still, there are few signs that labor activity at Amazon is cooling off, with a variety of labor organizations and unions taking their shots at organizing the nation's second largest employer. Amazon Labor Union filed last week for its first union election on the West Coast, at a warehouse in Moreno Valley, Calif. Other groups around the country are trying to form independent unions. Home Depot's Philadelphia workers want the company to address deteriorating working conditions caused by labor shortages and understaffing, according to Vince Quiles, 27, a leader of the Home Depot unionization effort in Philadelphia. Home Depot has an open-door policy to ensure that employees can bring their concerns to leadership, company spokeswoman Sara Gorman said. Home Depot respects its employees' right to unionize, but does not believe collective bargaining is the solution to worker concerns, she said. But Quiles cited the Amazon union efforts in New York as an inspiration. ""I saw what  was able to do in Staten Island,"" Quiles said. ""I thought if they can do it with 8,300 workers at Amazon, then we have a shot making it happen with 300 people here.""","<Incident Category>: freedom of association and collective bargaining, poor employment conditions, salaries and benefits

Their reign, however, may be nearing its rightful end, as America's law enforcers are waking up to the threats the Big Three pose to investors and the economy. In an Aug. 4 letter to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, 19 state attorneys general questioned how the company's ESG advocacy squares with its fiduciary duties to investors. The attorneys general specifically raised whether BlackRock's ""coordinated conduct with other financial institutions""â€”i.e., the two other investing giantsâ€”to demonetize the oil-and-gas industry raises potential antitrust issues. The attorneys general are digging into an important matter, but there is a much more worrying question they must explore: Why are the Big Three pursuing these policies in lockstep? Why have no institutions in the financial-services industry except oneâ€”the recently launched Strive Asset Managementâ€”opted to place the investor first, by giving priority to profit over social issues? The seeming answer raises concerns far beyond the Big Three's anti-oil-and-gas collusion. Through their management of passive investments, the Big Three collectively hold the largest voting blocs for nearly the entire S&P 500. Among them, they control a predominant share of the exchange-traded fund, or ETF, market, and of most participants in nearly every other market. Two of the three (BlackRock and State Street) are publicly traded companies, and so their officers disclose under oath in regular federal filings their institutional shareholders. In this paperwork, they regularly tell us not only what they own, but who owns them. The answer reads like a punch line: The Big Three own each other and themselves. Start with Vanguard, the privately held company of the group. Though 100% of Vanguard's equity is held by its own managed funds, its investors hardly control them. The company's directors are also the trustees of its funds, tasked with appointing its managers. Those managers are the only ""owners"" with votes on the membership of Vanguard's board. It's difficult to imagine a more circular arrangement. But the rest of the Big Three come close. Vanguard is the largest owner of BlackRock and State Street, in each case followed by BlackRock. Taken together, the Big Three directly own about 19% of BlackRock and 22% of State Street. The companies also own controlling shares of many of the other institutional stockholders holding the Big Three's shares. After including those holdings, the Big Three cumulatively controlâ€”if indirectlyâ€”no less than about 32% of BlackRock's equity and 42% of State Street's. There are good reasons to worry about the downstream effects of the same set of players owning all the competing companies in other industries. Many in the academy have encouraged prosecuting these companies under Section 7 of the Clayton Actâ€”an antitrust statute, enacted in 1914, that bars any stock acquisitions or ownership that ""may substantially lessen competition."" Those concerns should be even stronger when the players in question not only own but control each other. The U.S. hasn't seen this sort of corporate entanglement since Teddy Roosevelt and William Howard Taft busted the original trusts a century ago. The Big Three's present relationship explains why none of them defect from the ESG game. They can't, because they're not independent actors. The few other genuinely independent actors in the systemâ€”such as Fidelityâ€”are privately held and controlled by families wealthy enough to prioritize luxury beliefs over productivity. Similarly, ownership and control explains why no other major player in the American financial-services industry defects and challenges the investing giants. State Street qualifies as one of the 15 largest banks in the U.S. The Big Three collectively hold controlling shares of 13 of the 14 othersâ€”with their directly controlled ownership shares ranging from about 17% to 25%, and their indirectly controlled ownership shares ranging from about 24% to 45%. The only exception is the Canadian-owned TD Group. No substantive competition exists within the ESG paradigm because under the noses of our antitrust regulators the Big Three have acquired shared control over one another and almost every potential competitor. That's not a situation that can be fixed with probing letters or industry-specific litigation alone. We're now facing the original problem that Congress wrote American antitrust laws to addressâ€”coordinated ownership of everything by concentrated cliques pursuing their own priorities at the expense of the common good. That demands the targeting and eventual dissolution of the Big Three. The 19 state attorneys general are doing necessary work, but they must aim higherâ€”for the head.

The telecommunications giant didn't admit or deny the allegations. Three executives from its investor relations team involved in the matter will pay $25,000 each to settle, also without admitting or denying the allegations.

So, the three AT&T investor relations executives made one-on-one phone calls with stock analysts at nearly two dozen firms. On these calls, the SEC said, the executives disclosed AT&T's internal smartphone sales data and how the numbers would affect internal revenue metrics, even though that information was considered ""material"" to investors.

CHICAGO, March 5 (Reuters) - U.S. chicken products are entering China without retaliatory tariffs after Beijing made poultry eligible for exemptions to the extra duties, shippers and an industry group said on Thursday.
Beijing lifted a nearly five-year ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat in November, a move the U.S. Trade Representative said at the time would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China.
""They knew that it was not in their best interest to have this duty, which could have impeded imports."" Tyson Foods said it was encouraged by China's decision to provide tariff exemptions on chicken.","CHICAGO, March 5 (Reuters) - U.S. chicken products are entering China without retaliatory tariffs after Beijing made poultry eligible for exemptions to the extra duties, shippers and an industry group said on Thursday. The additional tariff relief may help China follow through on pledges to significantly increase purchases of American agricultural goods as part of an initial trade deal signed in January. U.S. chicken company Tyson Foods Inc said it had already seen chicken shipments rise as a result. China said last month it would grant exemptions on retaliatory duties to 696 U.S. goods as part of efforts to ease the trade war between the world's two largest economies. U.S. poultry was not eligible for exemptions until this week, said Jim Sumner, president of the trade group USA Poultry and Egg Export Council. China-based importers have applied for and received exemptions from the 30% retaliatory duty, which Beijing recently reduced from 35%, he said. ""We now have product getting in without any retaliatory tariffs,"" Sumner said. Global meat and poultry suppliers are competing for sales to China, where an outbreak of the fatal pig disease African swine fever has shrunk the hog herd by more than 40% and raised the need for imports. Beijing lifted a nearly five-year ban on imports of U.S. poultry meat in November, a move the U.S. Trade Representative said at the time would lead to more than $1 billion in annual shipments to China. ""We are now on a level playing field with the other poultry suppliers to China,"" Sumner said. ""They knew that it was not in their best interest to have this duty, which could have impeded imports."" Tyson Foods said it was encouraged by China's decision to provide tariff exemptions on chicken. ""Many of our customers in China have already qualified, boosting our chicken shipments there,"" Tyson Foods said in an email. Sanderson Farms Inc said last week that since the ban was lifted, it had shipped to China or received customer orders in China for about 18 million pounds of chicken products. That included 137 loads of dark meat and 283 loads of chicken feet, Chief Executive Joe Sanderson said on an earnings call. Logistics problems linked to the outbreak of coronavirus in China have eased after temporarily disrupting meat shipments.

Meat processors like Tyson Foods, WH Group's Smithfield Foods and JBS USA temporarily closed about 20 slaughterhouses last month as workers fell ill with the new coronavirus, leading to shortages of certain products in grocery stores. Production remains lower than normal because of increased absenteeism and social distancing among employees. An Iowa state official said 555 employees at Tyson's Storm Lake plant tested positive for the virus, about 22% of the workforce. Tyson will stop slaughtering hogs at the facility and finish processing the animals over the next two days, according to a statement. It will resume operations next week following ""additional deep cleaning and sanitizing of the entire facility,"" the statement said. The closure is due partly to a delay in COVID-19 testing results and employee absences, according to Tyson. Tyson said it conducted large-scale COVID-19 testing at the plant in northwestern Iowa and implemented safety measures to protect employees like requiring them to wear masks. The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union called on the Trump administration and meat companies to do more to protect workers. The union reported more than 3,000 infections and 44 deaths among U.S. meatpacking workers, up from 35 deaths as of May 12. ""Too many workers are being sent back into meatpacking plants without adequate protections in place, reigniting more outbreaks in the plants and our communities,"" said Nick Nemec, a South Dakota farmer who is part of an advocacy group working with the union. The Storm Lake plant slaughters about 17,250 pigs a day when it is running at full capacity, according to industry data. That accounted for about 3.5% of U.S. production before the pandemic.

However, whites dominate the management at JBS, where 58 percent of managers are white, and Tyson, where 73 percent of managers are white. Blacks and Latinos are at higher risk of contracting the virus, and also more likely to suffer seriously from the illness than white people because of social inequities. A machinery operator who chose not to be identified for fear of losing his job at the Tyson Foods Chick-N-Quick plant in Rogers, Ark., said little has been done to spread workers out, stagger breaks or ensure that workers have proper protective gear. ""They have always provided gloves,"" he said through a translator. ""And they recently provided masks, but it was already too late. There were people hired to make sure there is â€?social distancing, but they don't really care for that, so it's impossible."" He said he knows dozens of workers who have gotten sick as well as several who have been hospitalized and died. His said his mother, who works at Tyson's Berry Street Plant in Springdale, Ark., contracted the virus and was off for 10 days and didn't get paid during that time. ""I've heard of some people being paid during their illness, but way more people who aren't paid,"" he said. ""I take little precautions like I don't touch a lot of surfaces and I wear a mask and my mask shield. I've also been thinking of quitting. Tyson won't pay us for staying home and being afraid."" The company is still reviewing the filing, but Worth Sparkman, a spokesman for Tyson Foods, said, ""Our top priority is the health and safety of all our team members, their families and the communities where our plants are located. We've transformed the way our plants operate to protect our team members, implementing measures such as symptom screening before every shift."" Cameron Bruett, head of corporate affairs for JBS USA and subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride, said the company has taken extra precautions to keep its facilities safe. ""Our efforts have followed, and often exceeded, CDC guidance. We welcome any review of our practices and response to the pandemic, along with the many opportunities we provide our team members from every background imaginable,"" he wrote in an email. A CDC report earlier this month found that 87 percent of workers infected by the virus at poultry, pork and beef processing plants were people of color, and at least 86 workers had died. The report looked at 16,000 cases of the coronavirus among workers at 239 plants in 21 states. At a moment when American workers, families and small businesses are suffering financial setbacks associated with the pandemic, advocacy groups are raising questions about the USDA's support of multinational corporations such as Tyson and JBS. ""The complaint is that the USDA should not be giving money to companies that are clearly engaging in racial discrimination,"" said Navina Khanna, director of the HEAL Food Alliance, a coalition of 55 organizations representing farmers and one of the complainants. Tyson received $165 million in 2019 for federal Farm Bill nutrition programs and trade mitigation program contracts and $109 million in 2020 thus far. JBS and its subsidiary Pilgrim's Pride received $147 million in 2019 and almost $46 million in 2020 so far. The USDA did not comment on the complaint. Suzanne Adely, co-director of Food Chain Workers Alliance, another of the complainants, said companies are not doing enough on social distancing at work and during breaks, and that many plants still do not have enough protective gear. ""They are aware that tens of thousands of workers are getting sick and dying and still they are failing to follow CDC guidelines,"" Adely said. Newell said that the complaint was filed with the USDA because it has oversight of civil rights infractions. ""This is occurring during our national reckoning with racism, and this complaint tells a story of extreme harm in the meat industry that places black and Latino workers in even greater harm.""","<Incident Category>: climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, impacts on communities, impacts on landscapes, greenhouse gas emissions, land ecosystems, negligence

Tyson Foods,TSN,2020/11/19,"occupational health and safety issues, violation of national legislation, epidemics pandemics, negligence","Tyson suspends managers pork plant bets workers COVID-19
As state officials and lawmakers urged the shutdown of a Tyson Foods pork-processing plant in Iowa, managers at the plant reportedly placed bets on how many would end up getting sick.
From April: Officials urge Tyson Foods to shut down plant after employees test positive for COVID-19 A week later, more than 620 people in the county had tested positive for the coronavirus and seven had died.
""Our countryâ€™s meatpacking workers, and the millions of American they serve, deserve and expect better from those sworn to protect us.â€?A USA TODAY investigation in April found that 1 in 3 of the nationâ€™s largest meat-processing plants, including those owned by Tyson, operated in counties with high rates of coronavirus infections.
This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Tyson suspends managers at pork plant who placed bets on how many workers would get COVID-19","As state officials and lawmakers urged the shutdown of a Tyson Foods pork-processing plant in Iowa, managers at the plant reportedly placed bets on how many would end up getting sick. That is one of the many new allegations leveled against Tyson Foods in an amended lawsuit filed Wednesday. The corporation kept its Waterloo, Iowa, plant open even as local officials urged its shutdown early in the pandemic. As a result, about 1,000 employees contracted COVID-19, five of whom died. That includes Isidro Fernandez, whose family filed the suit against the meat empire this year. Tyson Foods has since suspended the individuals reportedly involved, per a statement issued Thursday afternoon by the company. ""We expect every team member at Tyson Foods to operate with the utmost integrity and care in everything we do,"" said Tyson CEO and president Dean Banks in a statement. ""If these claims are confirmed, weâ€™ll take all measures necessary to root out and remove this disturbing behavior from our company."" The company, per the statement, will ""conduct an independent investigation"" helmed by Eric Holder, the Attorney General under former President Barack Obama. According to KWWL-TV in Waterloo, which obtained a copy of the amended lawsuit, managers at the plant repeatedly downplayed the severity of COVID-19 at the plant to both supervisors and processing workers. While supervisors were aware of the virus, avoiding the plant floor, they denied the existence of â€œconfirmed casesâ€?at the plant to workers. One manager, John Casey, directed supervisors to ignore symptoms of COVID-19 to continue to work and allegedly urged supervisors to direct their staff to do the same. Casey also reportedly likened coronavirus to a ""glorified flu."" In April, Black Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson publicly expressed concern over the Tyson plant remaining open. Around this time, according to the suit, plant manager Tom Hart allegedly began organizing the ""winner take all"" betting ring among managers and supervisors over how many employees would fall ill to COVID-19. From April: Officials urge Tyson Foods to shut down plant after employees test positive for COVID-19 A week later, more than 620 people in the county had tested positive for the coronavirus and seven had died. Ninety percent of the deaths, Black Hawk County Health Department director Dr. Nafissa Cisse Egbuonye said at the time, were linked to the Tyson plant. The company also offered â€œthank you bonusesâ€?of $500 for employees who attended every shift they were assigned for a period of three months. So workers, the lawsuit says, also would artificially lower their temperatures so they could continue working, even if they were ill. One worker at the Waterloo branch, according to the lawsuit, â€œvomited on the production lineâ€?and was granted permission to continue working. According to the Iowa Capital Dispatch, the company kept its plant open under the direction of President Donald Trump, who declared meatpacking plants ""essential"" in late April. â€œWithout immediate action, deadly outbreaks like this will quickly spread across the Midwest and cause COVID-19 cases to spike even higher,"" said Marc Perrone, president of UFCW, the union that represents the plant workers. ""Our countryâ€™s meatpacking workers, and the millions of American they serve, deserve and expect better from those sworn to protect us.â€?A USA TODAY investigation in April found that 1 in 3 of the nationâ€™s largest meat-processing plants, including those owned by Tyson, operated in counties with high rates of coronavirus infections. As of Thursday, Black Hawk County had reported more than 9,600 cases and 120 deaths. Follow Joshua Bote on Twitter: @joshua_bote.

Infections in the chickens being raised for meat triggered more restrictions on U.S. exports, with China blocking poultry products from Kentucky. Last week, buyers like China and Korea limited poultry purchases from Indiana due to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm there. The broiler chickens in Fulton County, Kentucky, located near the border with Tennessee, were infected with the same H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian flu as the turkeys in Indiana, Kentucky officials said. They said it is Kentucky's first outbreak of the highly lethal bird flu, which killed more than 50 million U.S. chickens and turkeys in 2015. Birds from the infected flock will be culled and will not enter the food system, state officials said. Tyson Foods is working with government authorities to prevent the disease from spreading and is heightening safety measures at other local farms, spokesman Gary Mickelson said. The outbreak is not expected to lower overall chicken production levels because thousands of farms raise chickens for Tyson, he said. Mickelson added that Tyson Foods' chicken products are safe to eat. On Tuesday, Kentucky officials expect final test results for a separate suspected outbreak among turkeys in Webster County, Kentucky. The disease was also detected in a backyard flock of birds in Fauquier County, Virginia, that have already been culled, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said. The cases do not present an immediate public health concern, the agency said. Wild birds are thought to be spreading the virus, after dozens tested positive along the U.S. East Coast. The United States is the world's largest producer and second-largest exporter of poultry meat, according to the U.S. government. Kentucky said it is the seventh biggest chicken-meat producing state. Almost 18% of U.S. poultry production is exported, and the industry is a major user of feed grains. The disease is hitting the market as poultry supplies are down due to strong demand and labor shortages at meat plants during to the COVID-19 pandemic. Government data showed U.S. frozen chicken supplies were down 14% from a year ago at the end of December while turkey inventories were down 23%.

Last month, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was finalizing three safety directives for those grounded 777s that will allow them to return to service. The FAA said the new directives, which were proposed in December after three reported in-flight fan blade failures, require enhanced inspections and modifications. The FAA said the directives would be effective April 15. In February 2021, FAA ordered immediate inspections before further flights, after the National Transportation Safety Board found a cracked fan blade on the United engine built by Pratt, a unit of Raytheon Technologies. Boeing must develop a service bulletin laying out steps airlines must take to meet requirements. FAA must approve that bulletin before the planes can return to service. In April 2021, Japan Airlines said it had retired its fleet of 13 Boeing Co 777s with PW4000 engines a year earlier than planned.

UnitedHealth Group,UNH,2022/7/29,"anti competititve practices, corruption, bribery, extortion and money laundering","Publishing, Healthcare Mergers Set Trial Antitrust Showdown Biden Administration; Judges hear Justice Department's challenges Penguin Random House's acquisition Simon & Schuster deal involving UnitedHealth Group
Two merger trials, each beginning Monday at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., will provide an early test for Biden administration antitrust enforcement and determine the fate of multibillion-dollar deals in the publishing and healthcare industries.
In one case the Justice Department is challenging book publisher Penguin Random House's nearly $2.18 billion acquisition of Simon & Schuster, a deal that would combine two of the industry's big-five publishers.
In the publishing case, the department argues the merger will hurt authors, especially bestselling ones, by reducing the number of publishing houses that compete for their work.
They also say their merger would benefit authors and consumers by combining Simon & Schuster's popular backlist of titles with Penguin Random House's ""industry-leading distribution structure and administrative systems."" ""Slice and dice the market any way you want, and you will find vigorous competition to acquire books, especially books that one or more publishers believe are most likely to succeed with consumers,"" the companies wrote.
The Justice Department, which filed suit last November, argues a combination of the two companies would create an entrenched giant that will ""dominate the U.S. publishing industry with revenues twice that of its next closest competitor."" Unlike the typical case that centers on a merger's likely impact on consumer prices or product quality, the government focuses on in-demand writers.
The Justice Department has staked its case on what it describes as the market for authors whose books are acquired through publisher advances of at least $250,000, which it said totaled over $1 billion in 2020.
Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster said the $250,000 number was an arbitrary one that encompassed about 1,200 books annually, or about ""2% of all books published by commercial publishers."" Penguin Random House's next-largest rival is HarperCollins Publishers, which, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by News Corp.","Two merger trials, each beginning Monday at the federal courthouse in Washington, D.C., will provide an early test for Biden administration antitrust enforcement and determine the fate of multibillion-dollar deals in the publishing and healthcare industries. In one case the Justice Department is challenging book publisher Penguin Random House's nearly $2.18 billion acquisition of Simon & Schuster, a deal that would combine two of the industry's big-five publishers. In the other, the department is seeking to block UnitedHealth Group Inc., the parent of the nation's largest insurer, from acquiring health-technology firm Change Healthcare, a deal valued at $13 billion. The lawsuits are part of the Biden administration's push to be more aggressive in bringing cases against deals that it believes will suppress competition. In the publishing case, the department argues the merger will hurt authors, especially bestselling ones, by reducing the number of publishing houses that compete for their work. Among its expected witnesses is Stephen King, a longtime Simon & Schuster author who has voiced support for the government's challenge. In the healthcare litigation, the department argues UnitedHealth's acquisition would give it access to sensitive industry data that it could use to harm competitors. The companies in both matters deny the allegations and say the government misunderstands their industries. The cases represent a conscious strategy by the Justice Department to expand the frontiers of merger enforcement, said William Kovacic, law professor at George Washington University and former chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. ""The stated objective of the government is to reclaim enforcement terrain that had been surrendered,"" Mr. Kovacic said. ""Both of these cases have elements that are intended to push the boundaries of antitrust law outward."" The publishing case, being heard by U.S. District Judge Florence Pan, an appointee of President Biden, comes amid years of industry consolidation. Penguin Random House, itself the result of a 2013 merger, is today the world's largest consumer-book publisher, boasting such top-selling authors as John Grisham, Ibram X. Kendi, and Margaret Atwood in the U.S. German media company Bertelsmann SE, which owns Penguin Random House, agreed in November 2020 to buy Simon & Schuster from ViacomCBSâ€”now called Paramount Global. Through July 16, Penguin Random House accounted for about 22% of all print books sold in the U.S., according to book tracker NPD BookScan, while Simon & Schuster, whose authors include Mr. King, Colleen Hoover and Bob Woodward, accounted for 9%. In court papers, the defendant publishers argue the industry is robust, with smaller publishers outpacing one or more larger rivals in book acquisitions every year. They also say their merger would benefit authors and consumers by combining Simon & Schuster's popular backlist of titles with Penguin Random House's ""industry-leading distribution structure and administrative systems."" ""Slice and dice the market any way you want, and you will find vigorous competition to acquire books, especially books that one or more publishers believe are most likely to succeed with consumers,"" the companies wrote. SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS What do you think will be the outcome of these two merger trials, and why? Join the conversation below. The Justice Department, which filed suit last November, argues a combination of the two companies would create an entrenched giant that will ""dominate the U.S. publishing industry with revenues twice that of its next closest competitor."" Unlike the typical case that centers on a merger's likely impact on consumer prices or product quality, the government focuses on in-demand writers. ""The evidence will show that the proposed merger would likely result in authors of anticipated top-selling books receiving smaller advances, meaning authors who labor for years over their manuscripts will be paid less for their efforts and fewer authors will be able to earn a living from writing,"" the department wrote in court papers. The Justice Department has staked its case on what it describes as the market for authors whose books are acquired through publisher advances of at least $250,000, which it said totaled over $1 billion in 2020. Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster said the $250,000 number was an arbitrary one that encompassed about 1,200 books annually, or about ""2% of all books published by commercial publishers."" Penguin Random House's next-largest rival is HarperCollins Publishers, which, like The Wall Street Journal, is owned by News Corp. HarperCollins accounts for about 10% of print books sold in the U.S. The case is expected to last about three weeks, with a decision anticipated in the coming months. The UnitedHealth case, in front of U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols, a Trump appointee, is on a similar timeline. UnitedHealth, which agreed in January 2021 to buy Change Healthcare for nearly $8 billion and assume another $5 billion in debt, wants to combine the technology firm with its own health-services arm, Optum. Change Healthcare provides services related to payment processes for healthcare systems, analytics for financing and billing, and tools that help hospitals make decisions about patient care. UnitedHealth has said the combined company could improve care by providing better information to doctors and reduce waste by making the healthcare payment process more efficient. The healthcare behemoth has grown in recent years with acquisitions that have faced only limited antitrust pushback. President Biden targeted healthcare markets, including insurance, hospital and prescription drug markets, as a focus in a July 2021 executive order that targeted competition issues. The Justice Department argues the deal will give UnitedHealth a virtual monopoly on a key tool that health insurers use to determine when a claim should be paid. And it says the company shouldn't be allowed to own Change Healthcare's data clearinghouse, which rival insurers use to compete with UnitedHealth. The company says it already has addressed any concerns about competition by agreeing to sell off one of Change's business lines that offers claims-processing services similar to Optum's. And it says that Optum has long had access to rival insurers' data because it had provided products and services to those companies. The company says no evidence exists that the data was ever used to provide competitive intelligence to UnitedHealth. ""The Department of Justice's highly speculative theories on our combination are simply wrong and do not reflect the realities of how our business or the health system works,"" Optum said.

GE, which sells jet engines and other equipment to the U.S. military, said all of its roughly 56,000 U.S. workers must be fully vaccinated by the Dec. 8 deadline or have a medical or religious exemption.
Most major U.S. airlines have said they expect to be treated as contractors because of their business with the government, and have announced plans to implement the vaccine requirement with no exceptions, except for those who qualify for accommodations for religious or medical reasons.
Write to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com and Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com GE, Union Pacific Mandate Covid-19 Vaccine for U.S. Workers","General Electric Co., Union Pacific Corp. and other large U.S. employers are imposing Covid-19 vaccine mandates for their workers to comply with a Dec. 8 deadline set by the Biden administration for companies that are federal contractors. Boeing Co., International Business Machines Corp. and Raytheon Technologies Corp. are other federal contractors that have already announced Covid-19 vaccine mandates for their U.S. staff. Together with GE and Union Pacific, these companies collectively employ more than 300,000 U.S. workers. Employees of government contractors are required to get vaccinated against Covid-19 under an executive order signed in September by President Biden. Contractors can request an accommodation for a religious belief or disability, but cannot opt out of the shot through Covid-19 testing. The White House has also said it plans to require companies that employ 100 or more workers to require their employees be vaccinated or undergo regular Covid-19 testing, but that policy is awaiting a formal rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. While some large companies, such as Walt Disney Co. and meatpacker Tyson Foods Inc., have imposed vaccine mandates, most businesses are awaiting more details from OSHA. Some companies have pushed back return-to-office plans and some business groups have raised concerns about the burden of complying with the standard. GE, which sells jet engines and other equipment to the U.S. military, said all of its roughly 56,000 U.S. workers must be fully vaccinated by the Dec. 8 deadline or have a medical or religious exemption. Like many companies, GE had previously said it was educating and encouraging its workers to get vaccinated but hadn't taken the step of requiring it. Union Pacific said it is abiding by the executive order pertaining to federal contractors because the railroad operator ships items like military equipment around the country for the armed services. ""Along with being our best defense against severe Covid-19 illness, vaccines are our best path forward out of the pandemic,"" Beth Whited, Union Pacific's human resources chief, said in a note to staff last week. Workers must report their vaccination status or have an approved medical or religious accommodation to exempt them. Union Pacific is offering incentives like extra vacation time to nonunion workers and cash payments to unionized workers. Failure to do so will result in discipline including termination for nonunion workers, while unionized workers can be medically disqualified from duty. Three unions that represent Union Pacific railroad workers have since filed suit over the vaccine mandate, saying that such changes need to be negotiated at the bargaining table. Union Pacific filed a countersuit Friday, which it said was necessary to prevent a disruption of operations. IBM said it adopted a mandate for U.S. employees by Dec. 8 regardless of where they work or how often they come to an office. ""This is in line with the policies of many of our clients and partners and consistent with President Biden's recent Executive Order for Federal contractors,"" IBM said. In August, IBM said it would require vaccines for U.S. staff who wanted to return to its offices. Most major U.S. airlines have said they expect to be treated as contractors because of their business with the government, and have announced plans to implement the vaccine requirement with no exceptions, except for those who qualify for accommodations for religious or medical reasons. Southwest Airlines Co. told staff in a memo last week that it would no longer put those employees awaiting a decision about a request for an accommodation on unpaid leave, as it had previously planned. The airline also told employees that those who receive the accommodations will in most cases be allowed to continue working. United Airlines Holdings Inc., which in August was one of the first major employers to require staff get the shots or face termination, is awaiting a court ruling on a lawsuit from a group of employees over the requirement. Delta Air Lines Inc. has imposed a healthcare surcharge on staff who don't get vaccinated but stopped short of a mandate. Delta CEO Ed Bastian has said his company is also a federal contractor and will comply with the federal mandate, but believes it won't have to resort to threatening termination in order to boost compliance. He said in an interview last week that about 90% of Delta employees were already vaccinated. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has moved to bar Covid-19 vaccine mandates by businesses, setting up a clash between his state and the Biden administration. Some large Texas-based employers, such as Southwest Airlines and American Airlines Group Inc., have said they won't follow Mr. Abbott's order.

United Parcel Service,UPS,2021/9/17,"poor employment conditions, salaries and benefits","UPDATE 4-FedEx labor shortfall hits quarterly profit, earnings forecast
(Adds details on UPS union labor force, Ground segment volumes) By Lisa Baertlein Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp posted a 7% drop in quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast on Tuesday, after labor shortages crimped earnings, slowed packages and drove up costs ahead of the all-important holiday peak season.
Shares in the Memphis, Tennessee-based company fell 4.6% to $240.50 in extended trading after FedEx said staffing problems resulted in a $450 million year-over-year increase in costs due to higher wage rates and overtime, increased spending on third-party transportation services and shipping hiccups.
""Overcoming staffing and retention challenges is our utmost priority."" FedEx said adjusted net income fell to $1.19 billion, or $4.37 per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $1.28 billion, or $4.87 per share, a year earlier.
On the heels of the report, FedEx lowered its full-year forecast for earnings, excluding items, to $19.75 to $21.00 per share.","(Adds details on UPS union labor force, Ground segment volumes) By Lisa Baertlein Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp posted a 7% drop in quarterly profit and cut its full-year forecast on Tuesday, after labor shortages crimped earnings, slowed packages and drove up costs ahead of the all-important holiday peak season. Shares in the Memphis, Tennessee-based company fell 4.6% to $240.50 in extended trading after FedEx said staffing problems resulted in a $450 million year-over-year increase in costs due to higher wage rates and overtime, increased spending on third-party transportation services and shipping hiccups. ""The impact of constrained labor markets remains the biggest issue facing our business"" and was a key driver for the first-quarter underperformance, FedEx Chief Operating Officer Raj Subramaniam said on a conference call with analysts. Most of the excess labor expense hit the company's Ground network - which is now rerouting 600,000 packages a day, or 6.4% of the segment's average daily volume during the quarter - to work around woes stemming from the labor shortfall, executives said. As an example, Subramaniam said its hub in Portland, Oregon, is just 65% staffed. That requires FedEx to pay more and send packages to other hubs - adding time, package miles and spending on outside help. ""We anticipate the cost pressures from network inefficiencies, such as the one I just illustrated, to persist through peak,"" Subramaniam said. ""Overcoming staffing and retention challenges is our utmost priority."" FedEx said adjusted net income fell to $1.19 billion, or $4.37 per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $1.28 billion, or $4.87 per share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 14% to $22.0 billion. On the heels of the report, FedEx lowered its full-year forecast for earnings, excluding items, to $19.75 to $21.00 per share. FedEx previously forecast 2022 earnings per share, excluding items, of $20.50 to $21.50. FedEx and competitor United Parcel Service Inc are sprinting to hire holiday help as the resurgence of Delta variant-driven COVID-19 infections threatens to increase e-commerce delivery demand during the holiday season, when package volume can easily double. FedEx aims to bring on 90,000 holiday workers. It hired 70,000 last year and 55,000 in 2019. Up-and-coming rival Amazon.com Inc is touting average pay of $18 per hour as it races to expand its own delivery network. Amazon's nonunion delivery contractors compete with FedEx and its Ground delivery partners for workers. UPS workers are unionized and among the highest paid in the industry. Shares in UPS shed 2.6% after the FedEx report. At the market close on Tuesday, shares in FedEx were down 10% over the past six months, while UPS shares gained 19%.

VF in recent years has worked to become less of a wholesale company, Mr. Swartz said.","VF Corp., the company behind brands such as Vans and the North Face, named a 20-year veteran as its next chief financial officer. The Denver-based apparel and footwear firm Thursday said that Matt Puckett, its vice president of global financial planning and analysis, will become executive vice president and chief financial officer. The move is set to take effect at the end of May after VF has closed out its fiscal year. Mr. Puckett will succeed Scott Roe, who is retiring after 25 years with VF, including the past six as chief financial officer. He is leaving to pursue other opportunities, the company said. VF didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. The company in January said its profit and sales for the quarter ended Dec. 26, 2020, fell due in part to store closures and lower consumer demand during the Covid-19 pandemic. Net income for the quarter fell 25.3% to $347.2 million and sales dropped 5.8% to $2.97 billion, compared with the prior-year period. Mr. Puckett, who joined VF in 2001, is likely to focus on integrating streetwear brand Supreme and expanding the direct-to-consumer business, said David Swartz, an equity analyst at Morningstar Research Services LLC, a research provider. VF bought Supreme in December for $2.1 billion. VF in recent years has worked to become less of a wholesale company, Mr. Swartz said. Its wholesale business generated 48.2% of sales for the quarter ended Dec. 26, while direct-to-consumer sales made up 51.3%, according to a securities filing. Royalties represented the remaining 0.5% of sales. The company has a history of selecting internal candidates for top positions, said John Kernan, a managing director at financial services firm Cowen Inc. Mr. Roe began in 1996 as an audit manager, while Steve Rendle, VF's chairman and chief executive, joined in 1999 as part of the North Face brand that VF acquired the following year.

What credit score do you need to qualify for a Wells Fargo loan? There is no minimum credit score required to take out a Personal Loan. Instead, the company will make its approval decision based on other financial factors, including your credit history, ability to repay, and other factors indicating your overall financial situation. Other comparable lenders have no specified minimum, such as Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Discover. However, you'll probably get a better rate with a higher score. Your credit score won't be impacted if you check your rates with Wells Fargo, as the lender will only perform a soft credit inquiry. However, Wells Fargo will generate a hard credit inquiry before your loan is finalized, which will likely negatively impact your credit score. A hard inquiry offers a lender a full view of your credit history, but it might hurt your credit score. Is Wells Fargo trustworthy? Personal Loan currently doesn't have a rating from the Better Business Bureau as the BBB investigates the company's profile. In the past, the BBB gave Wells Fargo an F in trustworthiness. The BBB measures trustworthiness by evaluating businesses' responses to consumer complaints, honesty in advertising, and transparency about business practices. Wells Fargo has been involved in a few recent controversies. Over the past several years: * Wells Fargo is still paying billions in settlements because its employees created fake bank accounts to hit sales goals, which became public knowledge in 2016. * The company paid the city of Philadelphia $10 million as a result of the city's claims that Wells Fargo engaged in predatory mortgage lending to racial minorities (2019). * The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency charged Wells Fargo $1 billion for overcharging and selling extra products to customers with auto and home loans (2018). If Wells Fargo's history bothers you, you may want to consider other options on Insider's list of the best personal loan lenders. How does Wells Fargo compare to other personal loan lenders? Personal Loan rates are similar to those offered by comparable lenders â€?though rates will depend on your particular profile. Here's how Wells Fargo compares to the competition: Min. credit score Unspecified Min. credit score Unspecified Min. credit score Unspecified APR 5.74% to 24.24% APR 6.99% to 24.99% APR 6.99% to 19.99% Origination fee?

No Personal Loan Discover Personal Loans Marcus Personal Loan Wells Fargo review vs. Discover review You can borrow up to $100,000 with Wells Fargo, which is a much higher maximum loan amount than Discover's $35,000. If you need a larger personal loan, Wells Fargo may be a better option. Wells Fargo's repayment terms range from one to seven years, while Discover's terms range from three to seven years. If you want a shorter term length â€?and to save money on overall interest in the process â€?Wells Fargo may be the choice for you. A distinguishing feature of Discover is its 30-day money-back guarantee on its personal loans. If you decide within 30 days of receiving your loan that you no longer want it â€?perhaps you found a better rate elsewhere â€?you can return the funds via check and won't be charged any interest. Wells Fargo doesn't have a similar unique perk. Wells Fargo review vs. Marcus vs. Goldman Sachs review Neither Wells Fargo nor Marcus by Goldman Sachs has a minimum credit score requirement, but if you have a lower credit score, your APR may be higher with Wells Fargo than Marcus. The top end of Well's Fargo's APR range is roughly 5% higher than Marcus' range. If your credit is in good shape, you'll likely pay a slightly lower interest rate with Wells Fargo than with Marcus. While neither company will charge you origination fees or prepayment penalties, Wells Fargo might charge a late fee of up to $39. Marcus might be a better option for you if you're worried about potentially missing a payment. Marcus offers a loan term range of three to six years, which is a tighter window than Wells Fargo's range of one to seven years. If flexibility in repayment terms is important to you, Wells Fargo may be a better choice. About the authors Liz Knueven is a personal finance reporter at Insider.

Braxton offered a good credit score and a track record of paying his mortgage bills on time for many years to Wells Fargo & Co. WFC. But it took him more than nine months to refinance his mortgage and he ended up at an above-market rate of 4%, after the bank allegedly obstructed his ability to complete the deal. Braxton on Friday filed a class action discrimination lawsuit in federal court in the Northern District of California that charges Wells Fargo with violating the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and Californiaâ€™s Unruh Civil Rights Act. Federal Magistrate Judge Kandis A. Westmore has been assigned the case. The lawsuit seeks a jury trial and a yet-to-be determined amount in compensation for Black Americans â€œwho have been victimized by Wells Fargoâ€™s intentional, knowing and systematic race discrimination, violating the contractual, commercial and civil rights ofâ€?members and causing millions (and perhaps even billions) of dollars in damages,â€?according to the complaint. Los Angles-based law firm Ellis George Cipollone Oâ€™Brien Annaguey LLP filed the lawsuit on behalf of plaintiff Braxton and said the amount in controversy exceeds $5 million. A Wells Fargo spokesperson did not comment on the lawsuit. Wells Fargo helped more Black homeowners refinance their mortgage than any of the other largest banks and the bank remains confident that it applies consistent underwriting practices regardless of the personâ€™s race or ethnicity, a bank spokesperson said. â€œOur analysis shows that additional, legitimate, credit-related factors that are not available in Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data were responsible for the differences in our refinance approval rate for black homeowners,â€?the bank said. Wells Fargo was the only bank out of 12 major lenders in the U.S. that approved a smaller share of refinancing applications from Black homeowners in 2020 than it had in 2010, the lawsuit said. The lawsuit cited a March 11 Bloomberg report that revealed that Wells Fargo approved 47% of Black homeowner refinancing applications in 2020, compared to 72% for white applicants, 67% for Asian applicants and 53% of Hispanic applicants. The lawyer for the plaintiff, Dennis S. Ellis, said the statistical difference between Wells Fargoâ€™s approval rate and other banks is dramatic. â€œThereâ€™s clearly a problem here,â€?Ellis told MarketWatch. â€œI donâ€™t think you can eliminate the human element from this.

Advisor wins in high court. A former Ameriprise advisor has scored a victory at the U.S. Supreme Court in a case involving arbitration disputes that has the potential to dramatically alter the mechanism for contesting those closed-door proceedings. When an advisor challenges an arbitration ruling, the usual venue is a federal court, but after hearing the case that Denise Badgerow brought against Ameriprise, the Supremes ruled that those matters can be adjudicated in state courts. Avoiding the real estate trap. For many clients, the calculus around owning an investment property can change over time, and increased housing valuations coupled with the wave of boomers heading into retirement have many investors thinking about how to unload a decidedly illiquid asset.

Wells Fargo,WFC,2022/7/28,"fraud, violation of national legislation","Wells Fargo Wins Appeal 'Secret Agreement' Case, Arbitration Award Reinstated
A Georgia appeals court reversed a lower court's decision in a controversial Wells Fargo arbitration that attracted widespread attention because it alleged that a Wells Fargo attorney had a secret agreement with industry self-regulator Finra to bar certain arbitrators from hearing his cases.
The appeals court's Aug. 2 decision comes a month after Finra released a report that cleared itself of any involvement in an alleged agreement with attorney Terry Weiss who represented Wells Fargo in the arbitration against an aggrieved investor.
In a letter to Finra, which was quoted in Judge Edwards' decision, Weiss wrote: ""It was made clear to me verbally that none of the Postell arbitrators would have the opportunity to serve on any one of my cases given the horrific circumstances surrounding the underling  case, the SEC investigation, the publicity and aftermath."" Leggett's attorney opposed the request.
Judge Edwards, who serves in the Superior Court of Fulton County in Georgia, said this alleged ""secret agreement"" only came to light because Finra accidentally included Pinckney among the potential arbitrators.
The appeals court's decision said Judge Edwards erred in vacating Wells Fargo's arbitration win, ruling that Leggett had not met the high bar necessary.
The decision also said that Finra arbitrators had acted within the rules and Finra's director was within his rights to grant Wells Fargo's requests to remove arbitrators.","A Georgia appeals court reversed a lower court's decision in a controversial Wells Fargo arbitration that attracted widespread attention because it alleged that a Wells Fargo attorney had a secret agreement with industry self-regulator Finra to bar certain arbitrators from hearing his cases. The appeals court's Aug. 2 decision comes a month after Finra released a report that cleared itself of any involvement in an alleged agreement with attorney Terry Weiss who represented Wells Fargo in the arbitration against an aggrieved investor. Wells Fargo PHOTO: Photo Illustration by Barron's Advisor; Dreamstime (3) Weiss referred comment about the appeal to Wells Fargo. A spokeswoman for the company said Wells Fargo was happy with the outcome, which now requires the original complainant, investor Brian Leggett, to pay Well Fargo's legal fees and arbitration costs amounting to $83,000 for the original case. ""We are pleased with today's  court ruling which overturned the court's erroneous judgment and found in our favor,"" the spokeswoman said in a statement. ""We were always confident in the merits of our appeal and are pleased that the Georgia Court of Appeals completely validated our position."" The appeals court's decision caps off a yearslong saga that began when Leggett filed an arbitration claim against Wells Fargo and his financial advisor in 2017, accusing them of mismanaging his investments. A three-person arbitration panel ruled against Leggett in 2019, and ordered him to pay the $83,000. Leggett filed a complaint in a Georgia state court, requesting that Wells Fargo's arbitration award be overturned. Vacating an arbitration is difficult, as courts generally defer to arbitration forums. In January, Judge Belinda Edwards vacated Wells Fargo's arbitration win, finding five reasons to do so, including that Wells Fargo's attorney had manipulated the arbitrator selection process; that the arbitration panel had erred in its decisions; and that the arbitrators had improperly calculated Wells Fargo's costs, which Leggett had been ordered to pay. Finra, a self-regulatory organization funded by its member firms, oversees the arbitration forums by which most investor disputes are decided. Finra provides each side in an arbitration with randomly generated lists of arbitrators; each side can strike names from the list and eventually get a three-person panel to decide their dispute. Arbitration is a closed-door affair, but awards are publicly available. In the Wells Fargo matter, Finra sent both sides lists of potential arbitrators. Weiss, the bank's attorney, asked Finra to remove arbitrator Fred Pinckney from consideration because of alleged bias relating to a previous arbitration case called Postell, which Weiss had lost. In a letter to Finra, which was quoted in Judge Edwards' decision, Weiss wrote: ""It was made clear to me verbally that none of the Postell arbitrators would have the opportunity to serve on any one of my cases given the horrific circumstances surrounding the underling  case, the SEC investigation, the publicity and aftermath."" Leggett's attorney opposed the request. Finra granted it without providing an explanation for its decision. Judge Edwards, who serves in the Superior Court of Fulton County in Georgia, said this alleged ""secret agreement"" only came to light because Finra accidentally included Pinckney among the potential arbitrators. She wrote in her decision: ""Permitting one lawyer to secretly redline the neutral  list makes the list anything but neutral, and calls into question the entire fairness of the arbitral forum."" Finra at first denied any agreement existed between itself and Weiss. After facing an outcry from investor advocates, press coverage, and scrutiny from two Democratic lawmakers, Finra hired a law firm to review the matter. Finra's report, released at the end of June, said there was no ""documentary evidence"" that an agreement existed. Finra staff had ""generally adhered to the  policies and procedures,"" according to the report, which said that ""it is clear that Finra is continually striving to make the arbitration selection processes more transparent for arbitration participants."" A Finra spokesman said the organization is implementing reforms recommended by the report. ""We remain committed to continually improving the arbitration system to serve all parties who use Finra's dispute resolution forum,"" the spokesman said in a statement. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, filed an appeal of Judge Edwards' ruling. The appeals court's decision said Judge Edwards erred in vacating Wells Fargo's arbitration win, ruling that Leggett had not met the high bar necessary. The decision also said that Finra arbitrators had acted within the rules and Finra's director was within his rights to grant Wells Fargo's requests to remove arbitrators. ""Given the text of the  rule, we cannot find that he exceeded his authority in making that determination,"" the appeals court wrote. Per the alleged agreement, even if it exists, Leggett had not ""shown that it impacted this arbitration,"" the appeals court wrote.

Wells Fargo,WFC,2022/11/29,"fraud, poor employment conditions, violation of international standards","Incentives lead employees cheat lie work
The scandal highlights how workplace incentives ""can be a cure as well as a poison,"" according to Tae-Youn Park, lead author on research published in the Academy of Management Annals that explores how incentive programs can unintentionally encourage bad behavior at work.
Leaders usually deploy incentives with the aim of boosting their organization's performance, but the focus on rewards can ""open you up to overlooking other important values,"" Park said.
In the case of Wells Fargo, at the time of the settlement, company chief executive Charles Scharf decried the conduct ""and the past culture that gave rise to it"" as ""reprehensible and wholly inconsistent with the values on which Wells Fargo was built."" The prevalence of workplace incentives is rooted in behaviorist theory, which was derived from work with laboratory animals, as human behavior expert Alfie Kohn wrote in the Harvard Business Review in 1993.
Incentive programs â€?like piecework pay for factory workers, stock options for top executives and commissions for salespeople â€?don't tend to produce lasting changes in people's behavior, Kohn argued.
The consequences of incentives have a lot to do with how they're set up, Park said.
But with incentives that are challenging but achievable ""people tend to focus on the goal over the value of what they're doing,"" Park said.
And while many incentives rely on financial rewards, the reality is that ""money brings out the worst in people, and it almost never brings out their best,"" Becker said.
For example, financial incentives for whistleblowers work best when workers believe that the behavior will, indeed, be recognized and rewarded, one study found.","In 2020, Wells Fargo paid $3 billion to settle claims that employees had committed widespread consumer abuses, including opening millions of unauthorized or outright bogus accounts, forging signatures, and moving money from real accounts to fake ones. Regulators zeroed in on Wells Fargo's incentive system, intended to juice sales. Employees ""secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses,"" according to the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The scandal highlights how workplace incentives ""can be a cure as well as a poison,"" according to Tae-Youn Park, lead author on research published in the Academy of Management Annals that explores how incentive programs can unintentionally encourage bad behavior at work. Park, director of research at Cornell University's Institute for Compensation Studies, along with researchers from Vanderbilt University and Hongik University, examined more than 360 articles and studies examining the relationship between incentive programs and ethics across a range of industries, including health care, for-profit business and education. Incentives are based on the controversial assumption that external rewards and punishments are the primary motivators of people's actions. Leaders usually deploy incentives with the aim of boosting their organization's performance, but the focus on rewards can ""open you up to overlooking other important values,"" Park said. In the case of Wells Fargo, at the time of the settlement, company chief executive Charles Scharf decried the conduct ""and the past culture that gave rise to it"" as ""reprehensible and wholly inconsistent with the values on which Wells Fargo was built."" The prevalence of workplace incentives is rooted in behaviorist theory, which was derived from work with laboratory animals, as human behavior expert Alfie Kohn wrote in the Harvard Business Review in 1993. Incentive programs â€?like piecework pay for factory workers, stock options for top executives and commissions for salespeople â€?don't tend to produce lasting changes in people's behavior, Kohn argued. ""Do this and you'll get that is part of the fabric of American life,"" Kohn wrote. Rewards, however, ""typically undermine the very processes they are intended to enhance."" The research reviewed by Park and his colleagues backs this up. In health care, for example, doctors who were rewarded for achieving goals such as better patient outcomes got higher bonuses by selectively admitting healthier patients, Park said. In education, the frequency of cheating on standardized tests by teachers or administrators was higher when teachers were rewarded for classes that performed better, according to data from Chicago public schools. In for-profit business, chief financial officers were more likely to withhold negative information about their firms if their bonuses were tied to the company's financial targets. The consequences of incentives have a lot to do with how they're set up, Park said. People aren't very motivated to cheat to hit goals that are too easy or entirely out of reach. But with incentives that are challenging but achievable ""people tend to focus on the goal over the value of what they're doing,"" Park said. He pointed to a program at Sears decades ago that rewarded auto service employees for strict sales quotas. The company discontinued the commissions in 1992 after allegations came out that employees were defrauding customers, overcharging and billing for unneeded repairs. In a news conference at the time, then-Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan said: ""It seems to me our incentive compensation programs created a wide opportunity for mistakes to be made,"" according to reporting from the Los Angeles Times. It is harder for workers to justify bad behavior if they are acting solely on their own behalf, Park said. Team-based incentives, on the other hand, can encourage members to ignore or conceal ethical lapses to avoid disrupting the group. Studies that compared employees in individual incentive systems and team-based ones consistently showed that teams are more likely to falsify data and misrepresent products to juice performance. Systems like these can create a workplace culture that pulls employees away from their values, such as the Wells Fargo scandal, according to Christian Busch, director of the global economy program at at New York University's Center for Global Affairs. ""You create this fear among people that if you don't do 'x, y and z,' then you're out,"" Busch said. ""Because of this setting,  didn't have a lot of psychological safety so they didn't feel they could push back."" Companies often ""incentivize one thing and hope for something else,"" said Bill Becker, associate professor of management at Virginia Tech. And while many incentives rely on financial rewards, the reality is that ""money brings out the worst in people, and it almost never brings out their best,"" Becker said. Becker worked on a study published in 2018 that found that setting compensation goals led to more examples of dishonest managers getting paid bonuses for hitting certain targets. Such behavior creates a slippery slope: Dishonesty became increasingly worse once managers had passed a certain threshold, the researchers found. People are much more motivated by recognition and positive reinforcement than they are by short-term rewards, Becker said. ""What we really want is to be respected and valued,"" Becker said. ""That's when we're really doing our best work, but that takes great leaders who do that on a daily basis."" Stress and pressure can also entice employees to cut corners to achieve goals, Park said. When worker are ""cognitively or emotionally exhausted,"" they lose their resources for self-regulation. ""When they lose those, they will just think about the short-term goals in front of them,"" Park said. ""Then they're more prone to act in an unethical way."" Lack of accountability measures can also tempt bad behavior in incentive programs. When an incentive to lie or cheat is presented without monitoring or penalty, ""the likelihood of ethically questionable behaviors such as overclaiming performance increases,"" according to the Academy of Management Annals research. In one experiment at a call center, workers were told their company was cutting back on audits of their work. In reality, the company continued monitoring and found a sharp spike in workers boosting bonuses by logging fake calls. Incentives can be useful in some contexts, Park noted, especially when organizations are explicitly trying to encourage ethical behavior, like whistleblowing. For example, financial incentives for whistleblowers work best when workers believe that the behavior will, indeed, be recognized and rewarded, one study found. Another concluded that such incentives are especially helpful when the degree of the misconduct is lower, because people already feel stronger motivation to speak up â€?with or without a reward â€?when faced with severe ethical breaches.","<Incident Category>: fraud, poor employment conditions, violation of international standards

Xcel Energy,XEL,2022/4/25,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, greenhouse gas emissions","Tariff Probe Casts Shadow U.S. Solar Build-Out; NextEra, Xcel Southern cite delays Commerce Department investigates Chinese manufacturers
California Gov. Gavin Newsom told the department in a letter Wednesday that the investigation has caused the delay of numerous new solar and battery storage projects expected to come online through 2024.
She said it would move ""as fast as possible, consistent with the statute to conduct that investigation."" The risk of such tariffs has halted some exports to the U.S. and caused delays or cancellations by project developers, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, an industry trade group.
Chief Executive John Ketchum said if the Commerce Department moves to impose new tariffs, it could take as long as two years for the agency to do so, creating further uncertainty that he expects would bring additional delays and force developers to buy solar equipment from China, where tariff rates are known.
Mr. Newsom said in his letter to the Commerce Department that the investigation has delayed at least 4,350 megawatts of new solar and storage projects, including more than 400 megawatts of new capacity that was expected to come online this year.
In a securities filing, Southern said that Georgia Power, one of its subsidiaries serving more than 2.6 million customers in that state, expects a one-year delay in completion of about 970 megawatts of contracted solar projects as a result of both the Commerce Department's investigation and other supply-chain challenges.","American utilities are anticipating a significant slowdown in the build-out of new solar farms amid a U.S. probe into Asian solar panels that has created uncertainty for developers and manufacturers and caused widespread delays and cancellations. Companies including NextEra Energy Inc., Xcel Energy Inc. and Southern Co. have recently flagged the effects that the solar panel probe, led by the Commerce Department, could have on projects in the works this year, with several anticipating monthslong delays in completion. California Gov. Gavin Newsom told the department in a letter Wednesday that the investigation has caused the delay of numerous new solar and battery storage projects expected to come online through 2024. At the request of a small solar-panel manufacturer in California, the Commerce Department is investigating whether Chinese solar producers are illegally circumventing tariffs by routing operations through Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia. The investigation could culminate in the retroactive imposition of significant tariffs on solar cells and modules from Chinese companies operating out of those countries, which produce roughly 80% of U.S. solar imports. The department is expected to issue a preliminary determination by the end of August. At a U.S. Senate committee hearing this past week, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said that her ""hands are very tied"" in response to a question about whether the agency could expedite its decision to give clarity to the solar industry. She said it would move ""as fast as possible, consistent with the statute to conduct that investigation."" The risk of such tariffs has halted some exports to the U.S. and caused delays or cancellations by project developers, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, an industry trade group. The group cut its solar installation forecasts for 2022 and 2023 by 46%, or 24 gigawatts of capacity, more than the industry installed in all of 2021. NextEra, one of the nation's largest renewable energy developers, disclosed last week that it expects as much as 2.8 gigawatts of solar and storage projects to shift from this year to next year because of the delays. The company expects to build as much as 30 gigawatts of wind, solar and storage between 2021 and 2024. Chief Executive John Ketchum said if the Commerce Department moves to impose new tariffs, it could take as long as two years for the agency to do so, creating further uncertainty that he expects would bring additional delays and force developers to buy solar equipment from China, where tariff rates are known. He said U.S. solar assemblers, which aren't capable of supplying the entire domestic market, are sold out through 2024. ""The option that you have, as an industry participant, is to go back to China, which is just an outrageous outcome,"" Mr. Ketchum said in an interview. ""If they think they're being tough on trade with China, they're really just being tough on American projects that won't get built because you don't have the panels to build them."" The delays and potential cost increases come at a challenging time for the utility industry. The war in Ukraine is exacerbating supply-chain snarls, inflation and a global natural-gas supply shortage that has made it more expensive for utilities to produce or purchase power. Already, U.S. electricity customers are facing some of the largest bills in years as a result of those factors, and analysts said utilities might face pressure from regulators to keep spending in check if gas prices and inflation rates remain elevated. ""Every utility is going to be exposed to not only the gas price environment, but also renewable price risks, as well as inflation,"" said Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza. ""Utilities are sometimes the biggest employers in a state, and everyone has seen what's happening to wage inflation."" The delays could pose serious challenges in California, where utilities have been racing to procure new renewable energy and battery storage to help offset the closure of several gas-fired power plants, as well as a nuclear plant that provides nearly 10% of the electricity generated in the state. Already, the state has been strained to keep the lights on in the summer as a severe drought crimps hydroelectric production throughout the West and wildfires threaten transmission capacity. Mr. Newsom said in his letter to the Commerce Department that the investigation has delayed at least 4,350 megawatts of new solar and storage projects, including more than 400 megawatts of new capacity that was expected to come online this year. In a securities filing, Southern said that Georgia Power, one of its subsidiaries serving more than 2.6 million customers in that state, expects a one-year delay in completion of about 970 megawatts of contracted solar projects as a result of both the Commerce Department's investigation and other supply-chain challenges. Those projects are now expected to come online at the end of 2024. Xcel, a Minneapolis-based utility company serving customers in eight states in the West and Midwest, said it is in negotiations with several solar developers facing difficulties meeting schedule and pricing agreements as a result of supply-chain issues brought about by the probe. One project in Minnesota is facing a delay in regulatory review because of pricing uncertainty. ""We're certainly seeing the disruptions,"" said Brian Van Abel, Xcel's chief financial officer. ""This really points to the importance of getting a domestic clean energy supply chain."" Timothy Puko and Yuka Hayashi contributed to this article. Write to Katherine Blunt at Katherine.Blunt@wsj.com Tariff Probe Casts Shadow on U.S. Solar Build-Out","Summary:
The matched summary describes the delay of solar and battery storage projects in the U.S. due to the Commerce Department's investigation of Chinese manufacturers, which has caused uncertainty and potential delays. The investigation has halted some exports to the U.S. and caused delays or cancellations by project developers, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. California Governor Gavin Newsom has urged the Commerce Department to move ""as fast as possible"" to conduct the investigation. The delay of solar and battery storage projects is expected to cause further delays and force developers to buy solar equipment from China, where tariff rates are known.

Analysis:
The incident category, climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, are all addressed in the summary. The delay of solar and battery storage projects is directly related to climate change and the use of renewable energy, as solar energy is a clean and sustainable source of energy that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Commerce Department's investigation is related to global pollution, as it is investigating Chinese manufacturers that may be contributing to pollution.

The New York statute gives the state's attorney general sweeping power to investigate and prosecute companies for potential financial fraud.

ExxonMobil and other oil companies have succeeded in court swatting down other lawsuits from left-leaning municipalities.

OIL CHECK Under chief executive Elon Musk, Tesla earned a profit and increased deliveries of its new Model 3 sedan in the third quarter.","THE LIGHTBULB Over the past few years, several state and local governments have sued big oil companies, seeking to hold them responsible for damages from rising seas and inland wildfires connected to climate change. So far, none of these lawsuits have seen much success. But that may soon change with a lawsuit just filed by the state of New York. On Wednesday, New York Attorney General Barbara D. Underwood sued the nation's largest petroleum company, ExxonMobil, for allegedly lying to investors about the financial risk climate regulations posed to its business. Underwood is relying on a particularly powerful, nearly 100-year-old securities law unique to New York. Other lawsuits by state and local governments â€?including three counties and cities in Colorado and the entire state of Rhode Island â€?do not have a similar measure backing them up. The New York statute gives the state's attorney general sweeping power to investigate and prosecute companies for potential financial fraud. ""Contrary to Exxon's attempts to spin this as a political witch hunt,"" said Patrick Parenteau, an environmental law professor at Vermont Law School, ""this is a very serious enforcement action alleging illegal conduct that reaches to the highest levels of the corporate structure."" For the past three years, Underwood and her predecessor as New York's top prosecutor, Eric Schneiderman, have used their authority under the Martin Act of 1921 to probe the company for documents related to its scientific research into climate change and to business decisions it made because the Earth is warming. The New York AG's office says it has found evidence that ExxonMobil kept two sets of numbers â€?one internal and one external â€?for calculating the cost of future greenhouse gas regulations. Doing so, the office alleged, gave investors the false impression that the company was on better financial footing than it actually was. ExxonMobil told The Post's Steven Mufson the allegations are ""baseless"" and ""a product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general's inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing."" ExxonMobil and other oil companies have succeeded in court swatting down other lawsuits from left-leaning municipalities. At the beginning of the year, New York City separately filed a lawsuit against ExxonMobil and four other oil majors for allegedly concealing the consequences of climate change to the public. The district court judge threw out the lawsuit in July, saying that climate change should be dealt with by Congress and the White House â€?not by the court system. A lawsuit filed by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland suffered a similar defeat over the summer. In those suits, the cities sought financial damages that would have helped them prepare for coastal flooding and other climate impacts. But the state of New York isn't seeking those sorts of damages to average citizens. Rather, it wants to protect ExxonMobil's own investors. And New York, the nation's investing epicenter, has significant power to protect stockholders. Unlike federal securities law, New York's Martin Act does not require the state to prove a company intended to defraud investors. Prosecutors only need to show that a firm misrepresented information or withheld it from investors. ""It's an unusually strong state-level securities law,"" said Michael Gerrard, an environmental law professor at Columbia Law School. ""New York State's law is stronger than that of most other states."" The Martin Act has been the bane of Wall Street banks for years as New York's attorneys general have wielded it to police the financial sector. Earlier this year, for example, Bank of America Merrill Lynch agreed to pay a record $42 million penalty after admitting to fraudulent practices in electronic tradings. Even through Exxon moved from its Manhattan headquarters to Irving, Tex., in 1990, the New York statute applies to all companies doing business in the state. The law's broad power has earned it the ire of many conservatives who say it is often used by overambitious attorneys general to target politically vulnerable industries, like the financial sector and now the oil business. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board has even called for its repeal. ""Today's lawsuit filed against ExxonMobil in New York is nothing more than a contortion of the securities litigation system,"" Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform, said in a statement Wednesday. ""In bringing this case, the state is yet again using the Martin Act as a political weapon. Litigation will not help us confront the challenge of climate change."" POWER PLAYS â€?The Trump administration just approved a plan to drill for oil in Alaska's federal waters: The oil industry in Alaska won a major victory when Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke announced he is greenlighting the first oil and gas production facility in federal waters in the state. Zinke called the decision another step forward for Trump's ""American energy dominance"" agenda. What it will look like: The project undertaken by Houston-based Hilcorp will take two years to complete and will produce up to 70,000 barrels a day at peak production two years after that, The Post's Darryl Fears reports. What is worrying environmentalists: ""Hilcorp, a major player in Alaska, has had a few environmental mishaps. In December 2017, Hilcorp Alaska discovered crude oil leaking from a subsea pipeline that connected a pair of oil production platforms in the Cook Inlet."" â€?Trump names a new FERC chairman: The White House announced Wednesday it will elevate Neil Chatterjee to the chairmanship of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The move comes as the previous chair, Kevin McIntyre, stepped down from leading the independent panel this week due to a ""serious health setback,"" according to his resignation letter. McIntyre, who was diagnosed with a brain tumor last year, will still stay on as a commissioner. What the move means: Chatterjee's nomination to be chair does not need Senate approval since he is already a commissioner. And it does not change the overall composition of the five-member panel. But it does put at its helm a Kentucky native and former energy policy adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) who is seen as sympathetic to the coal industry. What will change the panel: There is one opening on the panel and Trump earlier this month nominated the Energy Department's Bernard McNamee to fill it. Members of the Trump administration, including McNamee and his boss, Energy Secretary Rick Perry, unsuccessfully pushed for FERC to approve a plan to subsidize struggling coal and nuclear plants.

""The heads of agreement (a non-binding draft) is an important step towards the realisation of the Wilhelmshaven floating storage and regasification (FSRU) project,"" said Keith Martin, Uniper's chief commercial officer. ""The FSRU will provide LNG companies from the United States, but also other countries from around the world, with the opportunity to deliver LNG into the German and European markets,"" he said. LNG is seen helping the German government diversify away from pipeline gas arriving from Russia, Norway and the Netherlands. Suppliers, most notably Qatar and the United States, have expressed interest. The Wilhelmshaven FSRU is expected to have a send-out capacity of 10 billion cubic metres per year and will be Germany's first LNG terminal. It is expected to begin operating in the second half of 2022. Uniper and ExxonMobil will continue their discussions over the coming months to seek binding agreements, Uniper said. Wilhelmshaven is a deep-sea port close to storage facilities and pipelines. In December, Uniper said it had entered into agreements with Japanese shipping group Mitsui OSK Lines to own, operate and fund the FSRU. Uniper has always stressed its role will be a facilitator, handling the marketing of the volumes, developing the FSRU into a multi-user facility and finding more buyers keen on booking capacity. Longer term, it could use the capacity partly to optimise sales of LNG volumes it will be drawing from Freeport in the United States from second half of this year, where it has separately started global marketing efforts. Uniper said it will press on with receiving operations permits from the relevant authorities for Wilhelmshaven. In January, it struck a deal with Dutch firm Titan LNG to add logistics services at Wilhelmshaven. FSRUs are cheaper and quicker to build than on-shore terminals. Germany has three LNG terminal projects. Some observers are puzzled by the interest as many LNG terminals in the EU suffer from underutilisation, but concede new facilities will support further diversification as the market expands.

ExxonMobil,XOM,2019/9/15,tax optimization,"Louisianaâ€™s Coast Vanishing. Mining Companyâ€™s $100 Offer Save It?
Coastal Louisiana parishes announced on Thursday that they had reached a deal with a mining company over claims that its aggressive drilling for oil damaged the stateâ€™s vanishing coast, a settlement that could lead to other agreements with energy giants as the state scrambles to stop its disastrous land loss.
In a tentative agreement with 12 coastal parishes, the company, Freeport-McMoRan, said it would pay up to $100 million toward restoring the coast, much of which it could recoup through environmental credits.
In a statement, Ms. Landry said oil and gas companies had been operating within the scope of the law for decades and that the â€œcomplex and multifaceted problemâ€?of protecting and restoring Louisianaâ€™s coast â€œwill not be resolved in a courtroom.â€?Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat who in 2016 intervened as a third party in the lawsuits and encouraged other coastal parishes to sue the oil and gas companies, said he hoped other corporations would strike similar deals with the local governments.
The deal still needs the formal approval of all 12 parishes, which Mr. Carmouche said he expects before the end of the year, but the tentative settlement marks the latest turn in litigation battles against the oil and gas industry in Louisiana.","Freeport-McMoRanâ€™s deal to resolve claims that its aggressive drilling damaged the coast could lead to more. But oil giants like BP, ExxonMobil and Shell have bristled at the idea. Coastal Louisiana parishes announced on Thursday that they had reached a deal with a mining company over claims that its aggressive drilling for oil damaged the stateâ€™s vanishing coast, a settlement that could lead to other agreements with energy giants as the state scrambles to stop its disastrous land loss. In a tentative agreement with 12 coastal parishes, the company, Freeport-McMoRan, said it would pay up to $100 million toward restoring the coast, much of which it could recoup through environmental credits. Freeport-McMoRan is just one of 98 companies that have been sued in 46 lawsuits over coastal damage, according to John Carmouche, a lawyer representing eight of the 12 parishes that are part of the tentative agreement. But the deal is likely to blaze a trail for future negotiations between the parishes and industry leaders like ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP and Shell. â€œThis is definitely a starting point, and I think they all understand that the ones that come first get the better deals,â€?Mr. Carmouche said. More than 2,000 square miles of coast â€?roughly the size of Delaware â€?have sunk underwater since the 1930s. Studies, including those sponsored by oil and gas industry groups, have shown that private enterprise is responsible for a substantial portion of the land loss, largely from the construction of pipelines and access canals. But the energy industry has remained a powerful force in Louisiana, which accounts for 7 percent of all gas production in the United States and is capable of processing 3.3 million barrels of crude oil each day, according to the federal governmentâ€™s Energy Information Administration. Some of the largest oil and gas companies bristled at the idea that they would agree to a similar deal. â€œItâ€™s a long way away from presenting a legitimate solution,â€?said Melissa Landry, a spokeswoman for five of the defendants: BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil and Shell. She declined to say whether the companies had discussed possible settlements with the parishes. In a statement, Ms. Landry said oil and gas companies had been operating within the scope of the law for decades and that the â€œcomplex and multifaceted problemâ€?of protecting and restoring Louisianaâ€™s coast â€œwill not be resolved in a courtroom.â€?Gov. John Bel Edwards, a Democrat who in 2016 intervened as a third party in the lawsuits and encouraged other coastal parishes to sue the oil and gas companies, said he hoped other corporations would strike similar deals with the local governments. State officials have estimated that it would cost $50 billion to neutralize land loss. The money from the proposed settlement would go toward a Coastal Zone Recovery Fund, managed by the state, that would distribute the cash toward coastal projects in the affected parishes. â€œEnsuring these funds stay in the communities that are impacted for dedicated coastal restoration is why the state of Louisiana intervened in these lawsuits, despite the fact that they were filed before I was governor,â€?Mr. Edwards said in a statement, adding that he hoped the deal would be a model for future agreements. The deal still needs the formal approval of all 12 parishes, which Mr. Carmouche said he expects before the end of the year, but the tentative settlement marks the latest turn in litigation battles against the oil and gas industry in Louisiana. Private landowners allowed companies to use their lands, but some later sued after they said the companies had polluted their property. In 2017, a federal appeals court threw out a lawsuit from a state levee authority, which claimed that oil and gas companies had weakened New Orleansâ€™s defenses from storm surges by destroying coastal wetlands that act as a buffer zone. John Barry, a former member of the authority that led that charge, said on Thursday that he was glad to see Freeport-McMoRanâ€™s willingness to reach a settlement, but that it was a drop in the bucket compared with the impact of other companies that have larger operations in the state. â€œCompared to the scope of the problem, and the liability of the industry, itâ€™s a small but important step,â€?Mr. Barry said. Oliver Houck, a law professor who advised the parishesâ€?lawyer early in the case, said that the settlement was significant, but that he had nearly given up hope that larger companies would take responsibility for the disappearing coast. â€œThey just canâ€™t accept it,â€?he said.","<Incident Category>: tax optimization

But oil giants like BP, ExxonMobil and Shell have bristled at the idea. Coastal Louisiana parishes announced on Thursday that they had reached a deal with a mining company over claims that its aggressive drilling for oil damaged the stateâ€™s vanishing coast, a settlement that could lead to other agreements with energy giants as the state scrambles to stop its disastrous land loss. In a tentative agreement with 12 coastal parishes, the company, Freeport-McMoRan, said it would pay up to $100 million toward restoring the coast, much of which it could recoup through environmental credits. Freeport-McMoRan is just one of 98 companies that have been sued in 46 lawsuits over coastal damage, according to John Carmouche, a lawyer representing eight of the 12 parishes that are part of the tentative agreement.

More than 2,000 square miles of coast â€?roughly the size of Delaware â€?have sunk underwater since the 1930s.

ExxonMobil,XOM,2019/11/27,"climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, greenhouse gas emissions","ExxonMobil prevails York high-profile climate fraud case
ExxonMobil prevailed Tuesday in its much-watched legal battle with the state of New York, beating back claims that it misled investors for years in how it calculated the financial risks of climate change.
The office of Letitia James, New York's current attorney general, tried to show the company lied to investors by keeping two sets of books â€?one public, one private â€?for estimating the cost of complying with future climate regulations.
But ExxonMobil is in the business of producing energy, and this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case."" In the harshly-worded ruling, Ostrager said that the New York attorney general had not produced any investor who was harmed and that it failed to show ""that ExxonMobil made any material misstatements or omissions about its practices and procedures that misled any reasonable investor."" Ostrager went on to call New York's complaint ""hyperbolic"" and ""ill-conceived"" and said he did not find the testimony of any Exxon employee ""to be anything other than truthful."" During the trial, Ostrager appeared at times impatient with New York's lawyers.
She said that ""for the first time in history, ExxonMobil was compelled to answer publicly for  internal decisions that misled investors."" She said that ""Exxon's inability to tell the truth, further underscores the lies that have been sold to the American public for decades."" The New York case is hardly the only litigation Exxon faces when it comes to climate change.
In October, Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey sued Exxon for ""deceptive advertising to Massachusetts consumers and for misleading Massachusetts investors about the risks to Exxon's business posed by fossil fuel-driven climate changeâ€”including systemic financial risk."" Chloe Gotsis, a spokeswoman for Healey's office, said Massachusetts is not daunted by the ruling from New York since its claims relate to advertising, and not just cost estimates for complying with regulation.","ExxonMobil prevailed Tuesday in its much-watched legal battle with the state of New York, beating back claims that it misled investors for years in how it calculated the financial risks of climate change. The high-profile trial, which included testimony from former ExxonMobil chief executive and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, marked the culmination of a four-year-old probe under three different New York attorneys general, during which Exxon handed over millions of documents about its internal dealings. But that extensive effort wasn't enough to convince New York Supreme Court Judge Barry Ostrager that the oil and natural gas giant broke state securities laws when describing to shareholders how it analyzed the effect of future greenhouse gas regulations on the company's bottom line. During a 12-day trial this fall, the state tried to wield a powerful anti-fraud law, called the Martin Act, that does not require prosecutors to prove that a company intended to deceive investors. The office of Letitia James, New York's current attorney general, tried to show the company lied to investors by keeping two sets of books â€?one public, one private â€?for estimating the cost of complying with future climate regulations. But even with that relatively low bar, Ostrager found New York's allegations ""to be without merit"" and the use of the state's securities law to be a stretch in this case. Ostrager found that Exxon had been transparent about the two different ways it calculated those costs. ""Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change,"" Ostrager wrote in his ruling. ""ExxonMobil does not dispute either that its operations produce greenhouse gases or that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change. But ExxonMobil is in the business of producing energy, and this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case."" In the harshly-worded ruling, Ostrager said that the New York attorney general had not produced any investor who was harmed and that it failed to show ""that ExxonMobil made any material misstatements or omissions about its practices and procedures that misled any reasonable investor."" Ostrager went on to call New York's complaint ""hyperbolic"" and ""ill-conceived"" and said he did not find the testimony of any Exxon employee ""to be anything other than truthful."" During the trial, Ostrager appeared at times impatient with New York's lawyers. On the last day of proceedings, the state dropped two of its four claims against Exxon in a bid to narrow its argument and secure victory. Exxon saw the decision as vindication that it had been besieged by a politically motivated attack in a state controlled by Democrats. ""Today's ruling affirms the position ExxonMobil has held throughout the New York Attorney General's baseless investigation,"" Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said. ""We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change. The court agreed that the Attorney General failed to make a case."" ""Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change,"" he added. In a statement, the office of Letitia James, New York's current attorney general, insisted that the case had been worth pursuing. She said that ""for the first time in history, ExxonMobil was compelled to answer publicly for  internal decisions that misled investors."" She said that ""Exxon's inability to tell the truth, further underscores the lies that have been sold to the American public for decades."" The New York case is hardly the only litigation Exxon faces when it comes to climate change. With Congress too gridlocked to pass major climate legislation, many left-leaning states and cities have turned to the courts to hold oil companies accountable for their contributions to the changing climate.

Chloe Gotsis, a spokeswoman for Healey's office, said Massachusetts is not daunted by the ruling from New York since its claims relate to advertising, and not just cost estimates for complying with regulation. ""We will continue our work to hold the company accountable for its misrepresentations,"" she said. Logan said the emphasis on consumers and misinforming the general public in the Massachusetts case would avoid the need to find harm to a ""reasonable investor."" ""These cases will get easier to prove unfortunately as climate change gets worse,"" he said. ""But if you wait long enough for damage to be obvious, you miss the opportunity to prevent it in the first place."" In addition, a slew of other local governments -- including those of Baltimore, Rhode Island, San Francisco and Oakland, as well coalitions of communities in the mountains of Colorado and along the coast of California -- are seeking compensation from oil companies for the damage rising temperatures have already wrought to drought-plagued farmers and beachfront businesses. Those local governments claim Exxon and other oil companies have created a ""public nuisance"" -- a charge more typically brought against a noisy neighbor -- for the heat-trapping pollution their products have put into the atmosphere. So far, federal district courts have been sorting out whether the claims should be heard at the state or federal level. Oil firms have sought to move the cases to the federal court system since the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of the petroleum industry in a 2011 public nuisance suit.","<Incident Category>: climate change, GHG emissions, and global pollution, greenhouse gas emissions

ExxonMobil prevailed Tuesday in its much-watched legal battle with the state of New York, beating back claims that it misled investors for years in how it calculated the financial risks of climate change.

In the harshly-worded ruling, Ostrager said that the New York attorney general had not produced any investor who was harmed and that it failed to show ""that ExxonMobil made any material misstatements or omissions about its practices and procedures that misled any reasonable investor."" Ostrager went on to call New York's complaint ""hyperbolic"" and ""ill-conceived"" and said he did not find the testimony of any Exxon employee ""to be anything other than truthful."" During the trial, Ostrager appeared at times impatient with New York's lawyers.
She said that ""for the first time in history, ExxonMobil was compelled to answer publicly for  internal decisions that misled investors.""

The high-profile trial, which included testimony from former ExxonMobil chief executive and former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, marked the culmination of a four-year-old probe under three different New York attorneys general, during which Exxon handed over millions of documents about its internal dealings. But that extensive effort wasn't enough to convince New York Supreme Court Judge Barry Ostrager that the oil and natural gas giant broke state securities laws when describing to shareholders how it analyzed the effect of future greenhouse gas regulations on the company's bottom line. During a 12-day trial this fall, the state tried to wield a powerful anti-fraud law, called the Martin Act, that does not require prosecutors to prove that a company intended to deceive investors. The office of Letitia James, New York's current attorney general, tried to show the company lied to investors by keeping two sets of books â€?one public, one private â€?for estimating the cost of complying with future climate regulations. But even with that relatively low bar, Ostrager found New York's allegations ""to be without merit"" and the use of the state's securities law to be a stretch in this case. Ostrager found that Exxon had been transparent about the two different ways it calculated those costs. ""Nothing in this opinion is intended to absolve ExxonMobil from responsibility for contributing to climate change,"" Ostrager wrote in his ruling. ""ExxonMobil does not dispute either that its operations produce greenhouse gases or that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change. But ExxonMobil is in the business of producing energy, and this is a securities fraud case, not a climate change case."" In the harshly-worded ruling, Ostrager said that the New York attorney general had not produced any investor who was harmed and that it failed to show ""that ExxonMobil made any material misstatements or omissions about its practices and procedures that misled any reasonable investor."" Ostrager went on to call New York's complaint ""hyperbolic"" and ""ill-conceived"" and said he did not find the testimony of any Exxon employee ""to be anything other than truthful."" During the trial, Ostrager appeared at times impatient with New York's lawyers. On the last day of proceedings, the state dropped two of its four claims against Exxon in a bid to narrow its argument and secure victory. Exxon saw the decision as vindication that it had been besieged by a politically motivated attack in a state controlled by Democrats. ""Today's ruling affirms the position ExxonMobil has held throughout the New York Attorney General's baseless investigation,"" Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said. ""We provided our investors with accurate information on the risks of climate change. The court agreed that the Attorney General failed to make a case."" ""Lawsuits that waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change,"" he added.

ExxonMobil,XOM,2020/6/12,local pollution,"D.C. attorney general sues oil gas companies, alleging industry misled public climate change
The D.C. attorney general sued four of the world's largest oil and gas companies Thursday, asserting that they have engaged in a multimillion-dollar campaign over decades to deceive District consumers about the effects of fossil fuels on climate change.
""For decades, these oil and gas companies spent millions to mislead consumers and discredit climate science in pursuit of profits,"" Racine said in a statement.
On Wednesday, Minnesota's attorney general sued ExxonMobil Corp., Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging that the companies have been deceiving the public about climate change science.
""The District of Columbia, the city between two rivers that are rising, is at particular risk."" Mike Tidwell, founder and director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, welcomed the lawsuit as an opportunity for vulnerable communities disproportionately impacted by climate change to ""finally get the legal justice they deserve."" ""The Tidal flooding, the extreme precipitation events, the changing seasons, the deforestation because of extreme weather in D.C. and the region have all accelerated,"" he said.","The D.C. attorney general sued four of the world's largest oil and gas companies Thursday, asserting that they have engaged in a multimillion-dollar campaign over decades to deceive District consumers about the effects of fossil fuels on climate change. Attorney General Karl A. Racine said in a news conference Thursday that ExxonMobil, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron have violated the District's consumer protection law by presenting a ""false picture"" to residents about the damage their products have on the environment. The lawsuit, filed in D.C. Superior Court, alleges that the companies have known about the adverse environmental effects of their products since the 1950s. It seeks a court order for the companies to pay civil penalties, provide financial relief for consumers in the District and stop what Racine's office asserts are deceptive campaigns. ""For decades, these oil and gas companies spent millions to mislead consumers and discredit climate science in pursuit of profits,"" Racine said in a statement. ""OAG filed this suit to end these disinformation campaigns and to hold these companies accountable for their deceptive practices."" ExxonMobil spokesperson Casey Norton denied the allegations. ""This lawsuit further demonstrates the ongoing coordinated, politically motivated campaign against energy companies,"" he said in an email statement. ""Legal proceedings like this waste millions of dollars of taxpayer money and do nothing to advance meaningful actions that reduce the risks of climate change."" A Shell representative similarly dismissed the lawsuit. ""Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires cooperation between all segments of society, not lawsuits that masquerade as climate action and impede collaboration for meaningful change,"" said Anna Arata, a Shell spokeswoman. Chevron called the suit ""meritless"" and a distraction from ""constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change."" BP declined to comment. The District joins many other cities and states that have filed similar suits against the oil industry. On Wednesday, Minnesota's attorney general sued ExxonMobil Corp., Koch Industries and the American Petroleum Institute, alleging that the companies have been deceiving the public about climate change science. Similar suits have been filed in Baltimore and Massachusetts, among other localities. The D.C. case is built on what Racine said was a multiyear investigation that allegedly uncovered intentionally deceptive public relations campaigns by the four companies to conceal the environmental damage of fossil fuels for their own profit. The suit alleges that the companies drew inspiration from Big Tobacco by funding and promoting some of the same scientists who dismissed the connection between tobacco and cancer to cast doubt on evidence that climate change is man-made. The lawsuit also asserts that in recent years, the companies have exaggerated their investments in green energy as public awareness about climate change has grown. ""Defendants have shifted their advertising strategies to mislead DC consumers into believing that buying Defendants' products supports companies committed to reducing and reversing the effects of climate change,"" the lawsuit asserts. ""In fact, the opposite is true."" On Thursday, Racine called attention to the danger that fossil fuels pose to residents in the District, where he said the Tidal Basin is flooding more frequently and the summers are growing increasingly hot and muggy. ""Today, scientists calculate that the world has less than a decade left to get carbon emissions under control or face catastrophic impacts,"" he said.

(XOM, US) whether you know it or not. Itâ€™s found in some 2,553 mutual funds and numerous exchange-traded funds, for example. Thatâ€™s on top of the approximately 353,000 people who own it outright in their brokerage accounts. Which is why news that the oil and gas giant is ending 401(k) matching for its 75,000 employees is a big deal. Itâ€™s a signal that XOM is worried about its dividend and is taking drastic measures to shore up the payout, currently 87 cents per quarter. The 401(k) news was first reported by Reuters. The iconic industrial giantâ€”whose roots stretch back to 1870, when John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oilâ€”has been on the financial defensive for some time. Earlier this year, ExxonMobil said it was slashing capital spending 30% to $23 billion. Thatâ€™ll help maintain the dividend, which costs the company an estimated $15 billion a year. Read: New blow to workers â€?some companies are cutting 401(k) contributions The dividend has long been considered sacrosanct at ExxonMobil, a classic â€œwidows and orphansâ€?stock.

But the pandemic and resulting economic collapse which crushed energy prices has put the company in a vise. â€œXOMâ€™s balance sheet has been tested by the pandemic and the associated drop in crude oil prices, which have hurt operating cash flows,â€?writes CFRA analyst Stewart Glickman. â€œFor 2020, we see the company as roughly cash flow neutral, and thus preservation of the dividend (so far) has entailed more borrowing.â€?He adds: â€œAssuming crude oil prices do not relapse, we think XOM can sustain the dividend without additional borrowing.â€?This is pure guesswork, as the pandemic rolls on, including fears of so-called â€œsecond waveâ€?that could further hurt energy demand and prices. ExxonMobilâ€™s move is the latest in a wave of corporate retrenchments that have occurred since the pandemic and accompanying economic crisis began six months ago. Scores of companies have taken often drastic measures to shore up their balance sheets. Some companies laid off workers. Some furloughed themâ€”a fancy word for a temporary layoff. Others cut or suspended 401(k) contributions to workersâ€?retirement plans. Others took it to shareholders, slashing, or in some cases, eliminating dividends. This is unquestionably painful for income-oriented investors who have come to rely on dividends to maintain a certain standard of living. ExxonMobil, which just last week reported its second consecutive quarter of losses, amid â€œglobal oversupply and COVID-related demand impacts,â€?has said it remains committed to its dividend. But other oil majors have slashed theirs. Two examples: This spring, Royal Dutch Shell (RDS, AR) cut its dividend for the first time in 80 years; BP (BP, US)â€”after saying it was also committed to its dividendâ€”announced a 50% cut two days ago.","<Incident Category>: human rights abuses and corporate complicity, security services

ExxonMobil wants to get the record straight: The oil producer did not bribe President Trump with campaign donations.
The energy giant offered a clarification Monday evening after Trump described a detailed â€?but strictly theoretical â€?fundraising call involving the company's chief executive at a rally in Prescott, Ariz., earlier in the day.
""We are aware of the President's statement regarding a hypothetical call with our CEO,"" the company wrote on Twitter, ""and just so we're all clear, it never happened."" Trump first invoked the company's name onstage while claiming he could raise more money than Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who in recent months has gained a significant cash lead over the president.
Then, ExxonMobil stepped in with its unusual response to the president, denying Trump had offered to greenlight permits in exchange for millions of dollars in campaign contributions.
Going into September, Biden gained a $141 million cash lead over Trump for the first time in the campaign, a stunning reversal aided by a mix of big-ticket fundraising events and big news, including the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
""I would be the greatest fundraiser in history,"" he declared, noting that he would make Ducey â€?who comfortably outraised his Democratic challenger in 2018 â€?""look like a bad fundraiser."" At the rally, Trump acknowledged this kind of hypothetical call would be both easy and illegal for him to make.
""All I have to do is call up the head of every major Wall Street firm, the head of every major company â€?'Do me a favor, send me $10 million for my campaign,'"" Trump said.","ExxonMobil wants to get the record straight: The oil producer did not bribe President Trump with campaign donations.

""I call the head of Exxon. I don't know, you know, 'How are you doing? How's energy coming? When are you doing the exploration? Oh, you need a couple of permits?'"" Trump told supporters. ""I say, 'You know, I'd love  you to send me $25 million for the campaign.' 'Absolutely sir, why didn't you ask? Would you like some more?'"" Trump went on about how he could be the greatest fundraiser in U.S. history. Yet the fastest way to do so â€?offering favors to friends on Wall Street and in corporate headquarters across the country â€?would compromise his own job in the White House, he acknowledged. It is also illegal: Under federal law, soliciting these kinds of donations in exchange for specific policy outcomes is enough to land someone in prison. This particular scenario is only the latest example of Trump's jumbled, sometimes joking rally dialect. Yet after the rally, some following along online did not understand exactly where Trump was going with talk of a hypothetical bribery call. Had the president just laid out a textbook case of corruption? Then, ExxonMobil stepped in with its unusual response to the president, denying Trump had offered to greenlight permits in exchange for millions of dollars in campaign contributions. There is certainly no shortage of history between the president and the company, one of the world's largest oil producers. Months after Trump picked chief executive Rex Tillerson as his first secretary of state, his administration praised a chemical and natural-gas expansion from the company, apparently copying part of an ExxonMobil news release nearly verbatim to do so. Now, just two weeks ahead of Election Day, Trump has money on the mind. Going into September, Biden gained a $141 million cash lead over Trump for the first time in the campaign, a stunning reversal aided by a mix of big-ticket fundraising events and big news, including the death of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The same appears to be true in many down-ballot races, including in the hotly contested battle in Arizona for the Senate seat currently held by Sen. Martha McSally (R), who accompanied Trump to his events there on Monday. Her opponent, former astronaut Mark Kelly (D), is one of three Democratic candidates challenging Senate incumbents who have smashed fundraising records in the third quarter of 2020. While appearing beside Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) in Prescott, Trump appeared to be trying to counter Biden's recent cash haul by boasting about his own ability to rake in campaign contributions. ""I would be the greatest fundraiser in history,"" he declared, noting that he would make Ducey â€?who comfortably outraised his Democratic challenger in 2018 â€?""look like a bad fundraiser."" At the rally, Trump acknowledged this kind of hypothetical call would be both easy and illegal for him to make. ""All I have to do is call up the head of every major Wall Street firm, the head of every major company â€?'Do me a favor, send me $10 million for my campaign,'"" Trump said. ""I would take in more money, but you know what? I don't want to do that. Because if I do that, I'm totally compromised."" As the sound bite from the campaign trail became the latest target of liberal political outrage on Twitter, some critics pushed back against the president even talking about this kind of bribery. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) pointed out that exchanging policy for campaign dollars is illegal. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) chimed in, too. The hashtag #QuidProQuo began trending on Twitter. And then, Exxon joined the conversation, promptly shutting down any speculation of wrongdoing. Trump is no stranger to high-dollar fundraising, even in recent weeks. Faced with a money crunch that has forced his campaign to pull some TV ads, he met last month with several deep-pocketed GOP donors, according to Reuters. While he says he draws the line at offering them political favors, that did not keep him from dreaming about it, for all the world to see. ""If I made the call , I will hit a home run every single call,"" Trump said at the rally.

The fund is weighing in on what promises to be this year's most closely watched boardroom challenge where Engine No. 1, a newly launched hedge fund, is taking on one of corporate America's most recognizable companies and pushing for improved financial performance and a greater focus on clean energy. CalPERS, which owns about 10 million shares of Exxon valued at $418 million, and is one of the top 35 shareholders, said it would back all of Engine No. 1's four nominees because it feels the board would ""benefit from additional expertise in both its core business and in renewable energy technologies.""

Exxon, which is valued at $236 billion, has seen its share price climb 35% since January. ""We will continue to engage with our shareholders, including CalPERS, to discuss our clear strategy for succeeding in a lower-carbon future,"" said company spokesman Casey Norton. ""ExxonMobil is focused on meeting energy demand while developing technologies and commercializing opportunities to tackle emissions and enhance shareholder value in an energy transition,"" Norton added. Exxon's board currently has 13 members, but with one member's term set to expire, it is urging shareholders to vote in favor of its 12-person slate. Hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which owns $167.7 million worth of Exxon shares, plans to vote with the company, according to people familiar with the matter. CalPERS' announcement came after New York state's pension fund told Reuters on Friday it would back the hedge fund. Pension fund California State Teachersâ€?Retirement System (CalSTRS) has publicly backed Engine No. 1 since it unveiled its campaign late last year. New York state owns $336 million and CalSTRS owns $324 million worth of Exxon shares.

Exxon has fended off attempts in the past to get it to change its policies and leadership, but pressure has mounted since the top U.S. oil producer posted a historic annual loss for 2020 after the coronavirus pandemic slashed energy demand. To blunt investor criticism, Exxon since December has expanded its board, pledged to increase low-carbon initiatives and said it would lower the intensity of its oilfield greenhouse-gas emissions. In March, Exxon named activist investor Jeffrey Ubben and former Comcast Corp executive Michael Angelakis to its board. CalPERS said it would vote against Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin, a former chief executive of Malaysian state energy firm Petronas, whom Exxon also named to the board this year. The pension fund will also vote against former MetLife Inc Chief Executive Steven Kandarian, former Caterpillar Inc CEO Douglas Oberhelman and former International Business Machines Corp CEO Samuel Palmisano.

To make a difference, 'join forces with other people' Oreskes and Supran don't think ExxonMobil invented the idea that consumers are responsible for curbing climate change.","Summary List Placement When Naomi Oreskes lectures about climate change, she gets the same question over and over again. ""A member of the audience will say: 'Well, what can I personally do? What can I do as an individual to fix this problem?'"" Oreskes, a science historian at Harvard University, told Insider. ""Much less frequently do they say: 'What can we do about the way the fossil fuel industry is blocking policy action?'"" It's a common idea: That the best way to fight climate change is by making changes in your own life â€?using less energy, eating less meat, driving less, flying less. But according to Oreskes and her colleague, Geoffrey Supran, a key source of this sentiment is a set of communications campaigns from ExxonMobil. The researchers latest analysis indicates that the oil giant started blaming the climate crisis on consumers two decades ago. In a study published last week, Supran and Oreskes analyzed 180 ExxonMobil documents discussing climate change from 1977 to 2014. The set includes internal communications, peer-reviewed publications, and ""advertorials"" â€?advertisements fashioned to look like editorials and published in The New York Times op-ed section. Around the year 2000, the researchers found, a new trend emerged in the company's public-facing communications. The advertisements began to focus on how consumers use energy. ""Be smart about electricity use,"" one 2007 advertorial suggested, continuing: ""Heat and cool your home efficiently."" ""Improve your gas mileage."" ""Check your home's greenhouse gas emissions."" Focusing on how consumers power their homes and cars, Oreskes and Supran argue, helps ExxonMobil ""downplay"" its role in extracting and burning the fossil fuels that are filling the atmosphere with carbon dioxide and raising global temperatures. It places both the blame and the responsibility for solving the problem onto individuals. Oreskes thinks that these kinds of marketing campaigns from fossil-fuel companies in general helped fuel people's fixation on reducing their carbon footprints. In fact, BP coined the term ""carbon footprint"" in 2004. ""They talk about energy demand, they talk about need, they talk about use, and they use the term 'consumers.' And this is basically a way of shifting responsibility away from the producers â€?that is to say them, ExxonMobil â€?and onto the consumer,"" Oreskes said. A 1997 ad even encourages policy-makers to adopt this energy-saving mindset: ""Governments should encourage and promote voluntary actions by industry and citizens that reduce emissions and use energy wisely. Governments can do much to raise public awareness of the importance of energy conservation,"" it says. A discrepancy between how ExxonMobil talks privately and publicly In its internal communications, ExxonMobil didn't talk about consumer demand and energy efficiency very much, the new study found. ""In the private correspondence, they still recognize that climate change is caused by fossil-fuel use. It's caused by the burning and combustion of their product, the thing that they have built their corporation on, which is fossil fuels,"" Oreskes said. ""But in the public language, they use language that seems to shift the responsibility to the consumer."" Oreskes and Supran ran their collection of ExxonMobil documents through a program that analyzed them for language. Advertorials often used the terms ""emissions,"" ""risk,"" ""energy,"" ""energy efficient,"" ""meet,"" ""demand,"" ""use,"" and ""need."" The internal documents, on the other hand, mentioned carbon dioxide more than 1,000 times. Other terms that appeared the most were ""atmosphere"" or ""atmospheric,"" ""fossil fuel,"" ""ppm"" (which stands for parts per million, the metric by which scientists measure atmospheric carbon dioxide), ""fossil fuel combustion,"" and ""source."" Oreskes said her findings point to ""a systemic discrepancy between the way ExxonMobil has talked about this problem in private, versus the way they've presented it to the public."" In a statement to Insider, however, ExxonMobil alleged that Oreskes has a conflict of interest and pointed to her expert testimony in a climate-related lawsuit last year. ""This research is clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies,"" the statement said. Oreskes and Supran responded that they have both ""served as experts in a number of capacities to groups and organizations involved in fighting climate change."" ""These efforts present no conflict of interest,"" the researchers said. ""They are a logical application of our knowledge and expertise."" ExxonMobil added in its statement that the company ""is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies."" To make a difference, 'join forces with other people' Oreskes and Supran don't think ExxonMobil invented the idea that consumers are responsible for curbing climate change. But they say the company's language has influenced public discourse. ""I do think that the fossil-fuel industry rhetoric is probably part of the reason why so many people think of  in personal and individualistic terms,"" Oreskes said. ""This is what we've been reading and hearing for an awfully long time."" This isn't to say, though, that individual people can't do anything. If a significant portion of the population powered their homes and cars with renewable energy from solar panels or wind turbines, that would reduce the amount of carbon added to the atmosphere each year. Oreskes has solar panels on her roof and uses halogen lightbulbs in her home. But she recommends against letting lifestyle changes â€?like ""be smart about electricity use"" or ""improve your gas mileage"" â€?overshadow the bigger picture. About 70% of all industrial carbon emissions come from 100 fossil-fuel companies, according to a 2017 analysis by the charity CDP. ""I can change my lightbulbs as an individual. But I can't change my electricity grid. I can't change the policies that make it harder for renewable energy to compete. For that I have to join forces with other people,"" Oreskes said.

Discontented shareholders have grabbed a third seat on the ExxonMobil board of directors in a reflection of widespread unhappiness with the oil giant's climate change strategy and its financial performance in recent years.
ExxonMobil, which fought hard to defeat a four-person slate nominated by a small hedge fund called Engine No. 1, conceded in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that former Energy Department official Alexander Karsner had won a majority of votes from shareholders.
""It's a watershed event when an activist investor takes three seats on the board of such a major company, and with the energy transition front and center in the bid to replace several board members, it seems inevitable that Exxon will be rethinking its climate strategy,"" said Jason Bordoff, founding director of the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.","Discontented shareholders have grabbed a third seat on the ExxonMobil board of directors in a reflection of widespread unhappiness with the oil giant's climate change strategy and its financial performance in recent years.

Karsner placed 11th in a race for 12 board seats, about 1.2 percent ahead of two of ExxonMobil's nominees. Though the new board members will be in a minority, their presence could alter the tone of the oil giant's board meetings, where members are traditionally picked by the chief executive. And the three-person faction, which has vast industry experience, could persuade the other board members to reconsider key positions.

At the May 26 annual meeting, ExxonMobil announced that two of Engine No. 1â€²s other nominees, Gregory J. Goff, a longtime oil refining executive, and Kaisa Hietala, who ran a biofuels program at a Finnish oil refiner, had won spots on the board. Anders Runevad, a former executive at Vestas Wind Systems, fell short. The company and the hedge fund spent tens of millions of dollars, according to people familiar with the dispute, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak about internal deliberations. Many analysts have interpreted the results of the shareholder vote as a condemnation of ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods. Woods was reelected to the board after placing eighth in the voting, though his margin of victory was wide. Three of the people ExxonMobil nominated to the board were defeated. ""Shareholders have spoken and the message is clear. It's time for board accountability,"" said Anne Simpson, the managing investment director for board governance and sustainability at the California state pension fund.

ExxonMobil,XOM,2021/11/12,"impacts on landscapes, local pollution, marine coastal ecosystems, offshore drilling","Exxon lobbyist questions urgency climate's catastrophic risks
Just last month, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods assured lawmakers his company neither disputed the scientific consensus on climate change nor lobbied against efforts to cut carbon pollution.
Erik Oswald, a vice president and registered lobbyist for Exxon, during a Nov. 9 panel hosted by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in Santa Fe, N.M., highlighted his firm's financial interest in curbing carbon emissions rather than the dangers posed by climate change.
Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said in an email, ""The statements you provided lack appropriate context and are not representative of the company's positions on important issues, including climate change and carbon capture."" ""ExxonMobil has long acknowledged that climate change is real and poses serious risks,"" Norton added.
Exxon has run advertisements in U.S. media outlets, including The Post, where it has framed its carbon capture efforts as part of the company's social commitment to addressing global warming.
The Post came under fire last month for publishing online advertising from Exxon in the form of an interview with an executive about carbon capture next to columns about climate change, without prominently marking the ads as a paid promotion.
Oswald, who became vice president of strategy/advocacy at the company's low-carbon solutions division this year, outlined some of Exxon's plans for carbon capture technology during the panel discussion.
Exxon is exploring whether it and other companies can make Houston a hub for a project to remove huge amounts CO2 released by Texas's oil and gas industry, he said, by storing massive quantities of captured carbon underneath the shallows of the Gulf of Mexico.
Last month's congressional hearing was sparked by a secretly recorded conversation with an Exxon executive, who called the Biden administration's goals for cutting greenhouse gases ""insane"" and said that the company had funded ""shadow groups"" that fought government action on global warming.","Just last month, ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods assured lawmakers his company neither disputed the scientific consensus on climate change nor lobbied against efforts to cut carbon pollution. But a lobbyist for the oil giant struck a different tone less than two weeks later, according to a recording obtained by The Washington Post, suggesting global warming might not be so dire. Erik Oswald, a vice president and registered lobbyist for Exxon, during a Nov. 9 panel hosted by the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission in Santa Fe, N.M., highlighted his firm's financial interest in curbing carbon emissions rather than the dangers posed by climate change. ""Is it catastrophic inevitable risk? Not in my mind. But there is risk,"" he said, according to a recording that the watchdog group Documented shared with The Post. Oswald emphasized the push to advance technology pulling carbon dioxide out the air as a profit opportunity, rather than a way to mitigate global warming. ""The way we think about this is not as the Crusaders who are the climate fix,"" he said. ""We're looking at markets."" The contrasting messaging shows the tortured path that behemoth fossil fuel companies are navigating as climate activism targets their core businesses. Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said in an email, ""The statements you provided lack appropriate context and are not representative of the company's positions on important issues, including climate change and carbon capture."" ""ExxonMobil has long acknowledged that climate change is real and poses serious risks,"" Norton added. ""In addition to our substantial investments in next generation technologies, ExxonMobil also advocates for responsible climate-related policies."" Oswald declined to comment. The commission Oswald addressed is a compact of dozens of states that ""assists member states in establishing effective regulatory practices to conserve and efficiently recover oil and natural gas resources,"" according to its website. While the precise impacts of global warming will be determined by the amount of fossil fuels burned in the coming years, scientists warn that ongoing climate disasters are sure to intensify given the greenhouse gases already unleashed by industrialization. A report released in August by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns of catastrophic consequences â€?intensifying droughts, fires, floods and storms â€?unless the world dramatically cuts greenhouse gases. Exxon's CEO emphasized the company's support for climate science when he testified under oath before the House Oversight and Reform Committee last month. ""Its public statements about climate change are, and have been, truthful, fact-based, transparent, and consistent with the views of the broader, mainstream scientific community at the time,"" Woods said in prepared remarks. He added during questioning by lawmakers that the company does ""not ask people to lobby anything different than our publicly supported position."" Fossil fuel companies and their allies in Congress, including Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), have insisted on providing generous subsidies for carbon capture from power plants as part of any plan to eliminate carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector by 2035. That comes on top of $7.3 billion in subsidies the Energy Department has spent on carbon capture and storage and related activities since 2009. Exxon has run advertisements in U.S. media outlets, including The Post, where it has framed its carbon capture efforts as part of the company's social commitment to addressing global warming. The Post came under fire last month for publishing online advertising from Exxon in the form of an interview with an executive about carbon capture next to columns about climate change, without prominently marking the ads as a paid promotion. ""ExxonMobil has captured more CO2 than any other company since the inception of the technology,"" the company said in one news release. Oswald, who became vice president of strategy/advocacy at the company's low-carbon solutions division this year, outlined some of Exxon's plans for carbon capture technology during the panel discussion. Exxon is exploring whether it and other companies can make Houston a hub for a project to remove huge amounts CO2 released by Texas's oil and gas industry, he said, by storing massive quantities of captured carbon underneath the shallows of the Gulf of Mexico. Many scientists believe carbon capture could play a helpful role in keeping the global average temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) compared to preindustrial levels. The world has already warmed at least 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit), and researchers warn that a temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius or more could trigger dangerous tipping points such as the melting of vast ice sheets and massive sea level rise. Oswald told the audience that Exxon sees federal support for carbon capture as a business opportunity. ""It's an expensive endeavor, and we all are going to pay for it either as taxpayers, or as consumers because there's no other source of funding for that to happen,"" said Oswald, who has worked at Exxon for over 30 years according to his LinkedIn profile. Responding to a question from another panelist about why the United States should subsidize carbon capture, while other major economies are not taking aggressive steps to curb their emissions, Oswald said there is opportunity in a market of naive consumers. ""It's a strange deal for a scientist but people are willing to pay a green premium. All around the world they are showing they're willing to do that,"" he said. ""Why they are doing that? That's another question. There are lots of markets that, I mean people bought sugar-free, there's all kinds of markets that are unhinged from hard facts."" Despite internal research identifying the risks from greenhouse gases decades ago, Exxon has a long history of casting doubt on the scientific consensus on global warming. In the mid-1990s, then-CEO Lee Raymond said in a speech that ""the case for so-called global warming is far from airtight."" Its officials questioned the findings of researchers at the U.S. Global Change Research Program and the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change after George W. Bush took office in 2001. But the company has since sought to portray itself as squarely on the side of most scientists and has launched a public-relations campaign touting its efforts to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions through methods like carbon capture. Exxon's campaign comes as the company is facing increasing pressure to curb its contribution to global warming. In May, renegade investors seeking to shift the company away from oil and gas managed to win three seats on Exxon's board of directors despite Woods's opposition. Last month's congressional hearing was sparked by a secretly recorded conversation with an Exxon executive, who called the Biden administration's goals for cutting greenhouse gases ""insane"" and said that the company had funded ""shadow groups"" that fought government action on global warming. The activist group Greenpeace UK taped the executive under the pretense of a job recruiting session, and a British news channel broadcast it in July. The controversy prompted Woods to issue a statement calling the executive's comments ""entirely inconsistent with our commitment to the environment, transparency and what our employees and management team have worked toward since I became CEO four years ago.""","<Incident Category>: impacts on landscapes, local pollution, marine coastal ecosystems, offshore drilling

Initial reports indicated an explosion of some kind had occurred inside the plant, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Twitter. Officials cautioned residents to avoid the area of the ""major industrial accident"" as deputies responded to the scene but did not issue an evacuation or shelter in place order. Three injured people were taken to hospitals by helicopters and a fourth was transported in an ambulance, Harris said. No fatalities were reported. Rohan Davis, the refinery's manager, said everyone else working at the site has been accounted for. The refinery, which can process up to 584,000 barrels of crude oil each day, employs about 7,000 people, according to the company's website. The fire occurred in a unit that produces gasoline and a section of the plant has been isolated but the rest is still in operation, Davis said. When asked if an explosion occurred, Davis said a fire broke out at the time of the event but that the company is still collecting information. ""We will do a thorough investigation to make sure an event like this doesn't happen again,"" Davis said. ""We're really sorry for what's happened."" The cause of the fire is not yet known.

The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has broadened its investigation into the role of fossil fuel companies in misleading the public about climate change, asking members of the boards of directors of ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell Oil to testify before Congress next month about their firms' commitments to curbing global warming.
The latest letters from the Oversight Committee, sent Thursday evening, call on directors at four of America's largest oil and gas companies to testify about whether their firms' commitments to cut emissions are consistent with the Paris climate accord adopted in 2015.
""The hearing is part of the Committee's ongoing investigation into the role of the fossil fuel industry in preventing meaningful action on global warming, including through misrepresenting the scale of industry efforts to address the crisis,"" the letters said.
Maloney (D-N.Y.), who chairs the Oversight Committee and is spearheading the investigation, told The Washington Post that ""boards of directors at fossil fuel companies have a critical role to play in holding management accountable for meaningful emissions reductions that will help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, which is the goal of the Paris accord."" Maloney added that she is prepared to subpoena the directors if they refuse to testify at the hearing, which is scheduled for Feb. 8, after ExxonMobil and Chevron have reported their fourth-quarter earnings.
""We expect all of the directors to show up and answer honestly,"" he said, noting that ""some of them got elected on a climate agenda."" One such director is Alexander ""Andy"" Karsner, an energy executive who was one of three activist investors to win a seat on ExxonMobil's board of directors in May, marking a surprise victory for Engine No. 1, a small activist hedge fund that has pushed the oil giant to adopt a stronger climate stance.
""In a relatively short period of time, we have delivered to the Committee thousands of pages of documents that speak directly to Shell's position on climate change over several decades, our strong support for the Paris Agreement and our efforts to be an industry leader in the transition to a lower-carbon future."" Karsner and spokesmen for BP, Chevron and Shell did not respond to requests for comment.","The House Committee on Oversight and Reform has broadened its investigation into the role of fossil fuel companies in misleading the public about climate change, asking members of the boards of directors of ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron and Shell Oil to testify before Congress next month about their firms' commitments to curbing global warming. The move by the powerful Oversight Committee comes as Senate Democrats struggle to pass sweeping climate and social spending legislation. President Biden acknowledged Wednesday that further cuts to his Build Back Better proposal may be necessary, and climate-fueled extreme weather events are intensifying around the country. Oversight panel members previously grilled the CEOs of the four oil and gas companies, as well as two trade associations they fund, at a historic six-hour hearing in October. The proceedings grew heated at times as Democrats argued that the oil industry has deceived the public for decades about the perils of burning fossil fuels, which releases large quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming Earth. The latest letters from the Oversight Committee, sent Thursday evening, call on directors at four of America's largest oil and gas companies to testify about whether their firms' commitments to cut emissions are consistent with the Paris climate accord adopted in 2015.

Maloney added that she is prepared to subpoena the directors if they refuse to testify at the hearing, which is scheduled for Feb. 8, after ExxonMobil and Chevron have reported their fourth-quarter earnings. The panel has already wielded its subpoena power to demand thousands of pages of documents regarding the fossil fuel companies' internal communications about climate change. ExxonMobil spokesman Casey Norton said the oil giant has been cooperating with the committee. ""We have been in regular communication with the committee since last summer and have provided staff with more than 200,000 pages of documents, including board materials and internal communications,"" Norton said in an email. ""In addition, our chairman and CEO voluntarily appeared before the committee and answered questions during the course of a six-hour hearing."" On Tuesday, ExxonMobil announced a target to achieve net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050. But climate activists panned the pledge as insufficient, noting that it did not cover ""scope 3â€?emissions, which include the emissions from drivers filling up at gas stations, and which account for the vast majority of the company's carbon pollution. ""We have to look past the window dressing and really ask, what are these companies actually pledging in terms of getting to net zero? And how are they going to actually achieve that?"" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Oversight subcommittee on the environment. ""We expect all of the directors to show up and answer honestly,"" he said, noting that ""some of them got elected on a climate agenda."" One such director is Alexander ""Andy"" Karsner, an energy executive who was one of three activist investors to win a seat on ExxonMobil's board of directors in May, marking a surprise victory for Engine No. 1, a small activist hedge fund that has pushed the oil giant to adopt a stronger climate stance. Khanna and Karsner have crossed paths before. The two men had dinner together in Silicon Valley a decade ago, after Khanna's time as deputy assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama. Ten years later, Khanna said he plans to press Karsner on comments made by ExxonMobil's chief executive, Darren Woods, at the last oversight hearing in October. Woods told the panel that the company's past statements about climate change have been consistent with the scientific consensus on global warming. In response, Maloney read aloud statements from one of Woods's predecessors, Lee Raymond, including a 1997 speech in which Raymond said ""the case for so-called global warming is far from airtight."" The speech came after ExxonMobil's own scientists had warned top brass at the company about the dangerous effects of greenhouse gases, including rising sea levels. ExxonMobil has been in the committee's crosshairs since July, when Greenpeace UK released a secretly recorded video of an ExxonMobil lobbyist boasting about the company's efforts to undermine climate science and block climate legislation. Keith McCoy, who at the time thought he was talking to a job recruiter, said the company had relied on ""shadow groups"" to fight climate science and had lobbied influential senators to undercut Biden's climate agenda. Karsner will not be the only board member in the hot seat next month. The Oversight Committee also fired off a letter to Susan Avery, an atmospheric physicist who serves as president emerita of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and was elected to ExxonMobil's board in 2017. To answer for Chevron, Democrats called on Enrique Hernandez Jr., CEO of a security services company who chairs the Chevron board's public policy and sustainability committee. The other two directors called to testify, Melody Meyer of BP and Jane Holl Lute of Shell, also sit on their boards' respective sustainability panels. Chevron, the second-biggest American oil company, announced in October an ""aspiration"" of net-zero emissions from its operations, a move similar to ExxonMobil's pledge. BP and Shell, which are both headquartered in Europe, have done more to transition toward low-carbon endeavors such as renewable energy projects and electric vehicle charging stations. Curtis Smith, a spokesman for Shell, said the company was still reviewing the letter. ""In the meantime, we're working hard to provide the Committee with materials requested in November of 2021,"" Smith said in an email. ""In a relatively short period of time, we have delivered to the Committee thousands of pages of documents that speak directly to Shell's position on climate change over several decades, our strong support for the Paris Agreement and our efforts to be an industry leader in the transition to a lower-carbon future.""

The proceedings grew heated at times as Democrats argued that the oil industry has deceived the public for decades about the perils of burning fossil fuels, which releases large quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are dangerously warming Earth. The latest letters from the Oversight Committee, sent Thursday evening, call on directors at four of America's largest oil and gas companies to testify about whether their firms' commitments to cut emissions are consistent with the Paris climate accord adopted in 2015. ""The hearing is part of the Committee's ongoing investigation into the role of the fossil fuel industry in preventing meaningful action on global warming, including through misrepresenting the scale of industry efforts to address the crisis,"" the letters said. ""As worsening natural disasters linked to global warming devastate communities in the United States and globally, one of Congress's top legislative priorities is combating the increasingly urgent crisis of a changing climate,"" they added. ""To do this, Congress must address pollution caused by the fossil fuel industry and curb business practices that lead to delay and disinformation on these issues."" Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), who chairs the Oversight Committee and is spearheading the investigation, told The Washington Post that ""boards of directors at fossil fuel companies have a critical role to play in holding management accountable for meaningful emissions reductions that will help the world achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, which is the goal of the Paris accord."" Maloney added that she is prepared to subpoena the directors if they refuse to testify at the hearing, which is scheduled for Feb. 8, after ExxonMobil and Chevron have reported their fourth-quarter earnings. The panel has already wielded its subpoena power to demand thousands of pages of documents regarding the fossil fuel companies' internal communications about climate change. ExxonMobil spokesman Casey Norton said the oil giant has been cooperating with the committee. ""We have been in regular communication with the committee since last summer and have provided staff with more than 200,000 pages of documents, including board materials and internal communications,"" Norton said in an email. ""In addition, our chairman and CEO voluntarily appeared before the committee and answered questions during the course of a six-hour hearing."" On Tuesday, ExxonMobil announced a target to achieve net-zero emissions in its operations by 2050. But climate activists panned the pledge as insufficient, noting that it did not cover ""scope 3â€?emissions, which include the emissions from drivers filling up at gas stations, and which account for the vast majority of the company's carbon pollution. ""We have to look past the window dressing and really ask, what are these companies actually pledging in terms of getting to net zero? And how are they going to actually achieve that?"" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Oversight subcommittee on the environment. ""We expect all of the directors to show up and answer honestly,"" he said, noting that ""some of them got elected on a climate agenda."" One such director is Alexander ""Andy"" Karsner, an energy executive who was one of three activist investors to win a seat on ExxonMobil's board of directors in May, marking a surprise victory for Engine No. 1, a small activist hedge fund that has pushed the oil giant to adopt a stronger climate stance. Khanna and Karsner have crossed paths before. The two men had dinner together in Silicon Valley a decade ago, after Khanna's time as deputy assistant secretary of commerce under President Barack Obama. Ten years later, Khanna said he plans to press Karsner on comments made by ExxonMobil's chief executive, Darren Woods, at the last oversight hearing in October. Woods told the panel that the company's past statements about climate change have been consistent with the scientific consensus on global warming. In response, Maloney read aloud statements from one of Woods's predecessors, Lee Raymond, including a 1997 speech in which Raymond said ""the case for so-called global warming is far from airtight."" The speech came after ExxonMobil's own scientists had warned top brass at the company about the dangerous effects of greenhouse gases, including rising sea levels. ExxonMobil has been in the committee's crosshairs since July, when Greenpeace UK released a secretly recorded video of an ExxonMobil lobbyist boasting about the company's efforts to undermine climate science and block climate legislation. Keith McCoy, who at the time thought he was talking to a job recruiter, said the company had relied on ""shadow groups"" to fight climate science and had lobbied influential senators to undercut Biden's climate agenda. Karsner will not be the only board member in the hot seat next month. The Oversight Committee also fired off a letter to Susan Avery, an atmospheric physicist who serves as president emerita of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and was elected to ExxonMobil's board in 2017. To answer for Chevron, Democrats called on Enrique Hernandez Jr., CEO of a security services company who chairs the Chevron board's public policy and sustainability committee. The other two directors called to testify, Melody Meyer of BP and Jane Holl Lute of Shell, also sit on their boards' respective sustainability panels. Chevron, the second-biggest American oil company, announced in October an ""aspiration"" of net-zero emissions from its operations, a move similar to ExxonMobil's pledge. BP and Shell, which are both headquartered in Europe, have done more to transition toward low-carbon endeavors such as renewable energy projects and electric vehicle charging stations. Curtis Smith, a spokesman for Shell, said the company was still reviewing the letter. ""In the meantime, we're working hard to provide the Committee with materials requested in November of 2021,"" Smith said in an email. ""In a relatively short period of time, we have delivered to the Committee thousands of pages of documents that speak directly to Shell's position on climate change over several decades, our strong support for the Paris Agreement and our efforts to be an industry leader in the transition to a lower-carbon future."" Karsner and spokesmen for BP, Chevron and Shell did not respond to requests for comment.","<Incident Category>: occupational health and safety issues, violation of national legislation, epidemics pandemics, negligence

ExxonMobil,XOM,2022/9/27,"impacts on landscapes, misleading communication","ExxonMobil ordered reinstate fired whistleblowers alleged fraud
When ExxonMobil announced unexpectedly bullish targets for pumping oil out of Texas and New Mexico in the spring of 2019, the news sparked confusion for two scientists at the company.
Damian Burch and Lindsey Gulden would soon complain to ExxonMobil's human resources investigators that Burch's team was pressured to doctor data to make it look like the company was poised to generate billions of dollars more in oil than it was, according to interviews and the findings of a Labor Department investigation.
Burch said he was so unnerved at being directed to gin up a scientific outlook bolstering the company CEO's misleading public statements that he named the file: ""Please_do_not_turn_this_into_a_lie.xlsx."" Eventually, the company acted on the concerns raised by the scientists, according to the federal investigation: It fired them.
Company officials said the scientists were not fired for blowing the whistle to federal agencies, but for violating company policies.
The company has said in court filings and public statements that the scientists misunderstood the projections and that investors were never misled.
The Labor Department investigation says the two scientists first became unnerved in April 2019, after the company announced in a financial disclosure that it was revising its estimate for oil it could pump from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico up to more than 1 million barrels per day by 2024.
The Labor Department's investigation concluded that the scientists believed Exxon ""was artificially inflating its oil production capacity to improve  public filings."" The day managers presented the inflated projections at an internal company meeting, Gulden went to the human resources department at ExxonMobil to report, according to the Labor Department findings, ""what she believed to be potential securities fraud surrounding the learning curve model and what was reported to the public."" ""I still believed in the integrity of the company and that it would police itself,"" Gulden said.
Burch stepped forward with his concerns a few weeks later, writing in an email to the human resources department: ""they asked us to turn any knobs we could in our modeling to get the forecast's  up, and they didn't care whether or not those new assumptions were realistic (they weren't)."" The scientists said company officials were receptive.
At that point, the company, according to the Labor Department findings, began to target the scientists.
Gulden declined to say whether she talked to a reporter, while Burch said the closest he got to the media was sharing a text he received from the Wall Street Journal with ExxonMobil management.
ExxonMobil, the department's report said, ""has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence"" that the scientists were fired for reasons other than talking to journalists and blowing the whistle.
""They are being handed on a silver platter evidence of significant violations,"" said Steve Kohn, an attorney for the scientists, who plan to file a complaint at the commission demanding tough penalties for ExxonMobil and the managers who orchestrated the firings.
""If the biggest oil company in the world fires you for cause, your career in oil and gas is over,"" said Burch, who now works for a minerals exploration company tied to the electric vehicle industry.","When ExxonMobil announced unexpectedly bullish targets for pumping oil out of Texas and New Mexico in the spring of 2019, the news sparked confusion for two scientists at the company. That confusion grew into alarm as the scientists began to suspect management planned to pin what they saw as a potentially fraudulent forecast on them. Damian Burch and Lindsey Gulden would soon complain to ExxonMobil's human resources investigators that Burch's team was pressured to doctor data to make it look like the company was poised to generate billions of dollars more in oil than it was, according to interviews and the findings of a Labor Department investigation. Burch said he was so unnerved at being directed to gin up a scientific outlook bolstering the company CEO's misleading public statements that he named the file: ""Please_do_not_turn_this_into_a_lie.xlsx."" Eventually, the company acted on the concerns raised by the scientists, according to the federal investigation: It fired them. ""I had never seen anything like this before,"" said Burch, who worked at the company for more than a decade and holds a doctorate in applied mathematics. ""Management said to just override the experts so we can get to the number the CEO has already blasted to the public. We could not find any evidence to support it. The science did not support it. The data did not support it. Nothing supported it."" Now, federal labor officials at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have ordered the oil giant to reinstate the two and pay them hundreds of thousands of dollars in back pay and damages in a case that has implications extending beyond the careers of these computational scientists. Exxon officials say they plan to appeal the order before an administrative law judge. ""We reject all claims made by the former employees and will defend the company accordingly,"" Exxon spokesman Casey Norton said in an email. ""The terminations in late 2020 were unrelated to the ill-founded concerns raised by the employees in 2019."" ""As we have stated throughout, we welcome the opportunity to meet with OSHA to provide additional information or witness interviews, as necessary,"" Norton wrote. Company officials said the scientists were not fired for blowing the whistle to federal agencies, but for violating company policies. The company argues the scientists misunderstood the data and that Exxon was able to exceed targets they disputed. ""The employees were neither qualified nor informed enough to offer an opinion, let alone a make a credible complaint,"" Norton said. The Labor Department's action could become a springboard to a more expansive targeting of fossil fuel companies, which already are facing unprecedented pressure from regulators and shareholders to reveal more about their operations. Companies like ExxonMobil are being pushed to be more transparent not just about their earnings projections and oil reserves, but also their exposure and contribution to climate change as regulators pursue rules requiring extensive new reporting on company emissions and their impact. ""If they can defraud investors and the public about this and get away with it, how can they be trusted with anything related to something as important as confronting climate change?"" asked Gulden, who also worked at ExxonMobil for more than a decade, after earning a doctorate in geoscience. ExxonMobil sees things differently. The company has said in court filings and public statements that the scientists misunderstood the projections and that investors were never misled. In a court filing earlier this year, the company produced a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission that said the agency had no plans to take any action after investigating whistleblower claims that the company duped shareholders. The filing came as ExxonMobil defended itself in a shareholder lawsuit in which the plaintiffs, including the state of Rhode Island, interviewed a dozen former employees and contractors who echoed the concerns of the fired scientists. That complaint against Exxon was dismissed late last week by a judge who found the plaintiffs had not provided adequate evidence to show company executives intentionally defrauded investors. But the judge's order also invited the plaintiffs to refile their complaint with more such evidence. The company continues to argue it is hitting its drilling targets. The Labor Department findings, however, suggest ExxonMobil's problems may be far from over. It concluded that the company violated laws meant to protect whistleblowers. Its central finding was that ExxonMobil fired Burch and Gulden because it suspected they brought their concerns to the media. Under federal law, according to the department, employees may not be fired for leaking information that reveals potential fraud against shareholders. Burch and Gulden ""suffered financial hardship and mental anguish because  illegally retaliated against them,"" according to the Labor Department's findings, which were released Thursday. ""The terminations were devastating for Complainants, who are high level professionals, neither of whom had ever been terminated from a position."" In addition to offering the scientists their job back, the department also directed Exxon to pay Gulden more than $385,000 and Burch more than $366,000 in back pay and damages. The department rejected company arguments that it could legally take action against employees for discussing company business with the media without authorization. The journey of the two scientists from longtime employees to whistleblowers is a cautionary tale for an oil industry facing stepped-up legal and regulatory pressures as it struggles to transition into the new energy economy. The disclosure rules the SEC is advancing around corporate exposure to climate change will bring new scrutiny to how companies like ExxonMobil manage and manipulate their data. The company was already under the microscope over allegedly false statements. It is a defendant in 20 lawsuits filed by states, cities and counties alleging that it lied to shareholders and the public for decades about its climate science, concealing internal findings that the continued use of fossil fuels could have catastrophic consequences. While the company prevailed in a suit filed by New York, judges in other large cases have rejected ExxonMobil's efforts to have them dismissed. ExxonMobil is also a target of an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation into allegations oil companies used the tobacco industry playbook to mislead the public and shareholders about the risks of their product. A member of the committee, Rep. Mark Desaulnier (D-Calif.), called Burch and Gulden ""heroes"" and said he plans to call for a House investigation into their firing by Exxon. The Labor Department investigation says the two scientists first became unnerved in April 2019, after the company announced in a financial disclosure that it was revising its estimate for oil it could pump from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico up to more than 1 million barrels per day by 2024. The forecast immediately struck Burch and Gulden as flawed, according to the government findings. All the data the scientists had reviewed concluded that drilling times could not be sped up anywhere near quickly enough to meet the company's target. The two told investigators that they objected to a manager's direction that Burch's team baked ""learning curve"" assumptions into its projections, which tweaked the forecasting formula to assume dramatically increased drilling speeds over five years. Gulden said in an interview there was not any empirical evidence that supported the aggressive projection. The Labor Department's investigation concluded that the scientists believed Exxon ""was artificially inflating its oil production capacity to improve  public filings."" The day managers presented the inflated projections at an internal company meeting, Gulden went to the human resources department at ExxonMobil to report, according to the Labor Department findings, ""what she believed to be potential securities fraud surrounding the learning curve model and what was reported to the public."" ""I still believed in the integrity of the company and that it would police itself,"" Gulden said. Burch stepped forward with his concerns a few weeks later, writing in an email to the human resources department: ""they asked us to turn any knobs we could in our modeling to get the forecast's  up, and they didn't care whether or not those new assumptions were realistic (they weren't)."" The scientists said company officials were receptive. ""We were told by H.R., 'Yep, this is definitely bad, and we will definitely take care of it,' "" Burch said. But months passed and nothing happened. Until late August of 2020, when the Wall Street Journal reached out to ExxonMobil asking about the company's projections in the Permian Basin. At that point, the company, according to the Labor Department findings, began to target the scientists. It fired Gulden, and it put Burch through what the former employee described as a harrowing inquisition that concluded with firing by the end of 2020. Burch said he was repeatedly interrogated about where he emailed company information. The company told government investigators that suspicions the two gave proprietary documents to the Journal drove the firings. Gulden declined to say whether she talked to a reporter, while Burch said the closest he got to the media was sharing a text he received from the Wall Street Journal with ExxonMobil management. ""After the guy contacted me, I thought about talking to him. But I chickened out and ended up reporting it to the ExxonMobil PR office,"" Burch said. It didn't matter either way. The Labor Department said it is illegal to fire employees suspected of bringing concerns of fraud to the news media. ExxonMobil, the department's report said, ""has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence"" that the scientists were fired for reasons other than talking to journalists and blowing the whistle. Experts in securities law said in interviews that the firings are certain to draw notice from the SEC. While the commission opted not to act on allegations the company defrauded shareholders, alleged illegal retaliation against employees is a separate issue. The SEC, which declined to comment, takes a hard line against such corporate behavior. ""They are being handed on a silver platter evidence of significant violations,"" said Steve Kohn, an attorney for the scientists, who plan to file a complaint at the commission demanding tough penalties for ExxonMobil and the managers who orchestrated the firings. The entire episode has been tough on the careers of the scientists, who lost jobs paying in the mid-$200,000s. ""If the biggest oil company in the world fires you for cause, your career in oil and gas is over,"" said Burch, who now works for a minerals exploration company tied to the electric vehicle industry. But they say the company needs to go beyond just offering their jobs back and change the way it operates. ""This kind of thing will continue to happen until there are consequences for the people who lack ethics,"" Gulden said. ""I just felt a responsibility to stand up and point out what went wrong here with the hope that other systems work and bring people to account.""","<Incident Category>: impacts on landscapes, misleading communication

Eventually, the company acted on the concerns raised by the scientists, according to the federal investigation: It fired them.
Company officials said the scientists were not fired for blowing the whistle to federal agencies, but for violating company policies.
The company has said in court filings and public statements that the scientists misunderstood the projections and that investors were never misled.
The Labor Department investigation says the two scientists first became unnerved in April 2019, after the company announced in a financial disclosure that it was revising its estimate for oil it could pump from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico up to more than 1 million barrels per day by 2024.
The Labor Department's investigation concluded that the scientists believed Exxon ""was artificially inflating its oil production capacity to improve  public filings."" The day managers presented the inflated projections at an internal company meeting, Gulden went to the human resources department at ExxonMobil to report, according to the Labor Department findings, ""what she believed to be potential securities fraud surrounding the learning curve model and what was reported to the public."" ""I still believed in the integrity of the company and that it would police itself,"" Gulden said.
Burch stepped forward with his concerns a few weeks later, writing in an email to the human resources department: ""they asked us to turn any knobs we could in our modeling to get the forecast's  up, and they didn't care whether or not those new assumptions were realistic (they weren't)."" The scientists said company officials were receptive.
At that point, the company, according to the Labor Department findings, began to target the scientists.
Gulden declined to say whether she talked to a reporter, while Burch said the closest he got to the media was sharing a text he received from the Wall Street Journal with ExxonMobil management.
ExxonMobil, the department's report said, ""has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence"" that the scientists were fired for reasons other than talking to journalists and blowing the whistle.
""They are being handed on a silver platter evidence of significant violations,"" said Steve Kohn, an attorney for the scientists, who plan to file a complaint at the commission demanding tough penalties for ExxonMobil and the managers who orchestrated the firings.
""If the biggest oil company in the world fires you for cause, your career in oil and gas is over,"" said Burch, who now works for a minerals exploration company tied to the electric vehicle industry.","When ExxonMobil announced unexpectedly bullish targets for pumping oil out of Texas and New Mexico in the spring of 2019, the news sparked confusion for two scientists at the company.

The Labor Department's action could become a springboard to a more expansive targeting of fossil fuel companies, which already are facing unprecedented pressure from regulators and shareholders to reveal more about their operations. Companies like ExxonMobil are being pushed to be more transparent not just about their earnings projections and oil reserves, but also their exposure and contribution to climate change as regulators pursue rules requiring extensive new reporting on company emissions and their impact. ""If they can defraud investors and the public about this and get away with it, how can they be trusted with anything related to something as important as confronting climate change?"" asked Gulden, who also worked at ExxonMobil for more than a decade, after earning a doctorate in geoscience. ExxonMobil sees things differently. The company has said in court filings and public statements that the scientists misunderstood the projections and that investors were never misled. In a court filing earlier this year, the company produced a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission that said the agency had no plans to take any action after investigating whistleblower claims that the company duped shareholders. The filing came as ExxonMobil defended itself in a shareholder lawsuit in which the plaintiffs, including the state of Rhode Island, interviewed a dozen former employees and contractors who echoed the concerns of the fired scientists. That complaint against Exxon was dismissed late last week by a judge who found the plaintiffs had not provided adequate evidence to show company executives intentionally defrauded investors. But the judge's order also invited the plaintiffs to refile their complaint with more such evidence. The company continues to argue it is hitting its drilling targets. The Labor Department findings, however, suggest ExxonMobil's problems may be far from over. It concluded that the company violated laws meant to protect whistleblowers. Its central finding was that ExxonMobil fired Burch and Gulden because it suspected they brought their concerns to the media. Under federal law, according to the department, employees may not be fired for leaking information that reveals potential fraud against shareholders. Burch and Gulden ""suffered financial hardship and mental anguish because  illegally retaliated against them,"" according to the Labor Department's findings, which were released Thursday. ""The terminations were devastating for Complainants, who are high level professionals, neither of whom had ever been terminated from a position."" In addition to offering the scientists their job back, the department also directed Exxon to pay Gulden more than $385,000 and Burch more than $366,000 in back pay and damages. The department rejected company arguments that it could legally take action against employees for discussing company business with the media without authorization. The journey of the two scientists from longtime employees to whistleblowers is a cautionary tale for an oil industry facing stepped-up legal and regulatory pressures as it struggles to transition into the new energy economy. The disclosure rules the SEC is advancing around corporate exposure to climate change will bring new scrutiny to how companies like ExxonMobil manage and manipulate their data. The company was already under the microscope over allegedly false statements. It is a defendant in 20 lawsuits filed by states, cities and counties alleging that it lied to shareholders and the public for decades about its climate science, concealing internal findings that the continued use of fossil fuels could have catastrophic consequences. While the company prevailed in a suit filed by New York, judges in other large cases have rejected ExxonMobil's efforts to have them dismissed. ExxonMobil is also a target of an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation into allegations oil companies used the tobacco industry playbook to mislead the public and shareholders about the risks of their product. A member of the committee, Rep. Mark Desaulnier (D-Calif.), called Burch and Gulden ""heroes"" and said he plans to call for a House investigation into their firing by Exxon. The Labor Department investigation says the two scientists first became unnerved in April 2019, after the company announced in a financial disclosure that it was revising its estimate for oil it could pump from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico up to more than 1 million barrels per day by 2024. The forecast immediately struck Burch and Gulden as flawed, according to the government findings. All the data the scientists had reviewed concluded that drilling times could not be sped up anywhere near quickly enough to meet the company's target. The two told investigators that they objected to a manager's direction that Burch's team baked ""learning curve"" assumptions into its projections, which tweaked the forecasting formula to assume dramatically increased drilling speeds over five years. Gulden said in an interview there was not any empirical evidence that supported the aggressive projection. The Labor Department's investigation concluded that the scientists believed Exxon ""was artificially inflating its oil production capacity to improve  public filings."" The day managers presented the inflated projections at an internal company meeting, Gulden went to the human resources department at ExxonMobil to report, according to the Labor Department findings, ""what she believed to be potential securities fraud surrounding the learning curve model and what was reported to the public."" ""I still believed in the integrity of the company and that it would police itself,"" Gulden said.

The scientists said company officials were receptive. ""We were told by H.R., 'Yep, this is definitely bad, and we will definitely take care of it,' "" Burch said. But months passed and nothing happened. Until late August of 2020, when the Wall Street Journal reached out to ExxonMobil asking about the company's projections in the Permian Basin. At that point, the company, according to the Labor Department findings, began to target the scientists. It fired Gulden, and it put Burch through what the former employee described as a harrowing inquisition that concluded with firing by the end of 2020. Burch said he was repeatedly interrogated about where he emailed company information. The company told government investigators that suspicions the two gave proprietary documents to the Journal drove the firings. Gulden declined to say whether she talked to a reporter, while Burch said the closest he got to the media was sharing a text he received from the Wall Street Journal with ExxonMobil management. ""After the guy contacted me, I thought about talking to him. But I chickened out and ended up reporting it to the ExxonMobil PR office,"" Burch said. It didn't matter either way. The Labor Department said it is illegal to fire employees suspected of bringing concerns of fraud to the news media. ExxonMobil, the department's report said, ""has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence"" that the scientists were fired for reasons other than talking to journalists and blowing the whistle. Experts in securities law said in interviews that the firings are certain to draw notice from the SEC. While the commission opted not to act on allegations the company defrauded shareholders, alleged illegal retaliation against employees is a separate issue. The SEC, which declined to comment, takes a hard line against such corporate behavior. ""They are being handed on a silver platter evidence of significant violations,"" said Steve Kohn, an attorney for the scientists, who plan to file a complaint at the commission demanding tough penalties for ExxonMobil and the managers who orchestrated the firings. The entire episode has been tough on the careers of the scientists, who lost jobs paying in the mid-$200,000s. ""If the biggest oil company in the world fires you for cause, your career in oil and gas is over,"" said Burch, who now works for a minerals exploration company tied to the electric vehicle industry. But they say the company needs to go beyond just offering their jobs back and change the way it operates. ""This kind of thing will continue to happen until there are consequences for the people who lack ethics,"" Gulden said.

The journey of the two scientists from longtime employees to whistleblowers is a cautionary tale for an oil industry facing stepped-up legal and regulatory pressures as it struggles to transition into the new energy economy. The disclosure rules the SEC is advancing around corporate exposure to climate change will bring new scrutiny to how companies like ExxonMobil manage and manipulate their data. The company was already under the microscope over allegedly false statements. It is a defendant in 20 lawsuits filed by states, cities and counties alleging that it lied to shareholders and the public for decades about its climate science, concealing internal findings that the continued use of fossil fuels could have catastrophic consequences. While the company prevailed in a suit filed by New York, judges in other large cases have rejected ExxonMobil's efforts to have them dismissed. ExxonMobil is also a target of an ongoing House Oversight Committee investigation into allegations oil companies used the tobacco industry playbook to mislead the public and shareholders about the risks of their product. A member of the committee, Rep. Mark Desaulnier (D-Calif.), called Burch and Gulden ""heroes"" and said he plans to call for a House investigation into their firing by Exxon. The Labor Department investigation says the two scientists first became unnerved in April 2019, after the company announced in a financial disclosure that it was revising its estimate for oil it could pump from the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico up to more than 1 million barrels per day by 2024. The forecast immediately struck Burch and Gulden as flawed, according to the government findings. All the data the scientists had reviewed concluded that drilling times could not be sped up anywhere near quickly enough to meet the company's target. The two told investigators that they objected to a manager's direction that Burch's team baked ""learning curve"" assumptions into its projections, which tweaked the forecasting formula to assume dramatically increased drilling speeds over five years. Gulden said in an interview there was not any empirical evidence that supported the aggressive projection. The Labor Department's investigation concluded that the scientists believed Exxon ""was artificially inflating its oil production capacity to improve  public filings."" The day managers presented the inflated projections at an internal company meeting, Gulden went to the human resources department at ExxonMobil to report, according to the Labor Department findings, ""what she believed to be potential securities fraud surrounding the learning curve model and what was reported to the public."" ""I still believed in the integrity of the company and that it would police itself,"" Gulden said. Burch stepped forward with his concerns a few weeks later, writing in an email to the human resources department: ""they asked us to turn any knobs we could in our modeling to get the forecast's  up, and they didn't care whether or not those new assumptions were realistic (they weren't)."" The scientists said company officials were receptive. ""We were told by H.R., 'Yep, this is definitely bad, and we will definitely take care of it,' "" Burch said. But months passed and nothing happened. Until late August of 2020, when the Wall Street Journal reached out to ExxonMobil asking about the company's projections in the Permian Basin. At that point, the company, according to the Labor Department findings, began to target the scientists. It fired Gulden, and it put Burch through what the former employee described as a harrowing inquisition that concluded with firing by the end of 2020. Burch said he was repeatedly interrogated about where he emailed company information. The company told government investigators that suspicions the two gave proprietary documents to the Journal drove the firings. Gulden declined to say whether she talked to a reporter, while Burch said the closest he got to the media was sharing a text he received from the Wall Street Journal with ExxonMobil management. ""After the guy contacted me, I thought about talking to him. But I chickened out and ended up reporting it to the ExxonMobil PR office,"" Burch said. It didn't matter either way. The Labor Department said it is illegal to fire employees suspected of bringing concerns of fraud to the news media. ExxonMobil, the department's report said, ""has failed to provide clear and convincing evidence"" that the scientists were fired for reasons other than talking to journalists and blowing the whistle. Experts in securities law said in interviews that the firings are certain to draw notice from the SEC. While the commission opted not to act on allegations the company defrauded shareholders, alleged illegal retaliation against employees is a separate issue. The SEC, which declined to comment, takes a hard line against such corporate behavior. ""They are being handed on a silver platter evidence of significant violations,"" said Steve Kohn, an attorney for the scientists, who plan to file a complaint at the commission demanding tough penalties for ExxonMobil and the managers who orchestrated the firings. The entire episode has been tough on the careers of the scientists, who lost jobs paying in the mid-$200,000s. ""If the biggest oil company in the world fires you for cause, your career in oil and gas is over,"" said Burch, who now works for a minerals exploration company tied to the electric vehicle industry. But they say the company needs to go beyond just offering their jobs back and change the way it operates. ""This kind of thing will continue to happen until there are consequences for the people who lack ethics,"" Gulden said. ""I just felt a responsibility to stand up and point out what went wrong here with the hope that other systems work and bring people to account.""","<Incident Category>: poor employment conditions, violation of national legislation

Covid-19 threw that plan into disarray. Ms. Peck, 50, quickly reset. She focused on being empathetic, listening to employees and customers and trying to address the challenges of that period by not using the pandemic as a reason to lay off workers. Zoetis employs roughly 12,000 people who make medicines, vaccines, diagnostics and technologies for animals in more than 100 countries. Its experimental Covid-19 vaccine was used to treat many types of animals. ""We had to deal with really difficult issues,"" said Ms. Peck, who is also a board member at money manager BlackRock Inc.

After college Ms. Peck worked in finance, making her way to specializing in private equity and real estate finance at the Prudential Realty Group. She spent five years as a consultant for the Boston Consulting Group, working across industries and on big strategic problems. But she struggled in her personal life, suffering five miscarriages. ""People believed I wasn't conceiving because my job was too stressful, I was traveling too much, and that if I really valued this, I would revolve my life around it,"" she said. Ms. Peck later wrote a book about her struggles with infertility. Ms. Peck interviewed elsewhere, and pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. won her over, citing its fertility benefits. She held a number of executive roles at Pfizer and realized she had a chance to be CEO if she got more operational business experience. Ms. Peck became a Pfizer group president in 2012, and the following year she helped spinoff Pfizer's animal health division into a public company, Zoetis. She joined the board of media company Thomson Reuters in 2016, giving her governance experience, and became CEO of Zoetis in 2020. Ms. Peck now is one of few women running a publicly traded company and also has two children.

Schwartz Executive chairman, Guggenheim Partners LLC Ms. Peck's first words to Mr. Schwartz were that she disagreed with him over a deal. At the time, Ms. Peck was chief of staff to Pfizer Vice Chairman David Shedlarz, and Mr. Schwartz was head of banking at Bear Stearns. They debated in Mr. Shedlarz's office on the 23rd floor of Pfizer's headquarters in Manhattan, and they saw each other over the next year as Pfizer worked on deals. Mr. Schwartz offered to mentor Ms. Peck, and has helped her manage a board, analyze data and build a coalition around different perspectives. He also advised her to listen to what people say, which he has told her can say a lot about them.

When a prior boss didn't want Ms. Peck to work from home on Fridays, she sought Mr. Schwartz's advice since she was worried the boss didn't think she was working. ""Deal with the substance, don't deal with the accusation,"" Ms. Peck remembers him advising her. Ms. Peck made her calendar visible and told the boss she would be available by phone if she was needed. Eric Pliner Chief executive, YSC Consulting When Ms. Peck became CEO of Zoetis, her longtime executive coach retired and she sought someone new. She reached out to Hubert Joly, then CEO of Best Buy Co. Inc., who recommended Mr. Pliner among others. Ms. Peck realized they'd be a good match because Mr. Pliner starts out by asking her to answer questions beginning with why, such as ""Why do you feel this way?"" or ""Why does that motivate you or others?"" she said. That helps her understand how to build coalitions on her leadership team and the Zoetis board. Mr. Pliner also pushes her to be clear on her expectations, such as specifying if she's looking for a view, a voice, a vote or a veto. For instance, ahead of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Ms. Peck said Zoetis's existing healthcare policies were in place to address women's health. After the decision came out, she realized she wanted to send a note to employees and it was important it came from her. Ms. Peck wasn't looking for a vote on whether the note would be sent or what the facts of the policies were. She did look for input from executives on the tone of how to communicate to colleagues the importance of supporting one another.
