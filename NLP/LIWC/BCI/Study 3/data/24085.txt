Several years ago, Mill Pond was born in the virtual world of Second Life as an MFA art project. The idea came from small collaborations between several Second Life users building off the creative actions of others, who in turn inspired others to share their own artistic expressions and experiences.What began as one small coffee shop became a community of hundreds of active users engaging with and becoming part of a vibrant community of artists, performers, and Second Life residents all eager to meet and connect with other people.Â Watching the transformation of Mill Pond from one instance to another as we experimented and grew was one of the most fascinating journeys of my life, and through all of the struggles and challenges, I still strongly believe that Mill Pond was an exceptional example of strangers coming together committed to the success of what many called their home.This project hopes to fund the return of Mill Pond for a period of six months, after which time the goal is to have the community be a self-sustaining, thriving, artistic oasis for residents of Second Life. The requested funding amount is made up of the $1,000 set up fee and 6 months worth of monthly maintenance fees at $295/month as per the Second Life website, plus the fees for Kickstarter (5% of total funds).The new blog is located at http://millpond.posterous.com!
