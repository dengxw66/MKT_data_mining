The brutal labor, sour thoughts, lucid exploits, and eventual addictions of the hollow (calloused Geist settles for less than) will be an installation that includes drawings, audio, video, structural elements, and an orchestrated performance with a large ensemble of musicians.  The title of the performance is "Black Licorice Blues".I am very excited about the concepts in this show.  I've been writing, thinking, and sketching all summer.  My brother is an accomplished musician and composer.  We are collaborating on the orchestration.  The money raised will be used to hire a large ensemble of musicians for rehersals, the evening performance, and a studio recording of the piece to be released on a limited edition cd with a booklet of the works included in the show.  It will also be used for all art related materials in and associated with the show.
