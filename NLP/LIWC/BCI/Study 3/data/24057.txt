100 drawings in 100 days, while promoting my art, also hones my technique, produces a substantial portfolio, and does so in a work space that accommodates my particular health needs.  The latter is most imperative as I suffer from severe chemical asthma, a condition that makes existing in your average work environment (and most living situations) virtually impossible for me.  (This resulted from surviving both inflammatory breast cancer and its ensuing aggressive treatment).  Ideal for several reasons, this project presents these images at a price affordable to most anyone -- 100.00 for an original.  More importantly, it allows me to draw in a scheduled and disciplined manner (something my precarious living and work situations had prevented until now) and to bring to fruition a number of ideas that had long been delegated to spin cycle.  The idea to place this project on Kickstarter came after having completed several weeks of drawings. At this point I found the project unable to financially sustain itself.  Of course the option to raise the price of my originals was there, but I felt this to be at odds with the projects original conception. I also came to the realization that producing a drawing a day was simply too taxing physically (often resulting in a 12 hour sketching day due to the intricate nature of my technique).  I posted an explanation regarding this via the project blog, voicing that some drawings may indeed take longer, but that I would be drawing every day, therefore making it contiguous.  Thus we arrive at the projects current manifestation.  The funds procured through Kickstarter will be used to cover the maintenance of this project, as well as the time and energy necessary to implement it.  Also, a certain amount will be allotted to cover the Kickstarter rewards that each donation is eligible for.
