The Project
A Creative Collaboration with Edna Brewer Middle School and The Crucible
The Crucible Sculpture Garden Project is a collaborative public art project intended to assist in the transformation of the grounds at Edna Brewer Middle School. The project is a model of how a school community can create a collaborative public art project that transforms an eyesore into a beautiful and colorful space which is part of the students' daily school life. This project began in 2006 with the students working collaboratively with The Crucible to create whimsical metal flowers which now decorate the walls of an abandoned space called "The Pit."  Due to lack of funding, no further work has been done in this space since that time. Once additional funding is secured for this next phase, the project will continue with the industrial arts theme with the students creating a life size black panther (the school's mascot) and panther paws with glass mosaic.  This project will be free of charge to any student who wishes to participate.  The Crucible is a non-profit educational facility that fosters a collaboration of arts, industry, and community.
Creative Collaboration -  Friday Evening Family Workshops at the Crucible
The Friday night family workshops will include five Friday evenings and one full Saturday starting in late fall or early January of the 2011-2012 school year.
This event will allow a significant number of Edna Brewer Middle School students as well as their family members, teachers, and community supporters to participate in the beautification of the school. It will create an opportunity for students, families, and friends to work and socialize together as they create a public art project for Edna Brewer Middle School. 
The exact dates will be announced at the beginning of the 2011-2012 school year.
