Spot and JJ's flippance has become a problem for some members of the rock community. Their presence, while constant, has become riddled with tales of hurt feelings, bruised ego's and infringed upon bar tabs. We're hoping to raise 1,000 dollars. This will be split between Spot and JJ under the condition that they change their attitudes and help coddle the coddled princes and princesses of AustinThey will also host a party if the goal is met**this party can only be attended by Trailer Space staff.
