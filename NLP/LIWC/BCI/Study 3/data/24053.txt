New Hope PA.....tattoo parlors, piercing salon, fetish boutiques, corseter, costumer, bar after bar after bar, memento mori shop, skate shop, live music...at it's core an awesomely dark, creative, fascinating place. Art and galleries abound, but THEy seem to have lost their edge. That's where *WE* come in.The New Hope Art Center has opened it's heart, and several small, individual studio spaces to working artists, and yours truly has managed to aqcuire one of them!!!!The good news: I have plans to set this up as a dark and edgy gallery featuring not only my art, but tattoo art, side show art, graphic novel work, rock art...sheer awesome. I will be renting space to other artists to show and sell their work too.The 'bad' news....the space I'm renting used to be a greasy spoon joint. It's kind of a wreck. LOL!The rent I can handle, but the work involved in creating a kick booty gallery out of this space is a bit daunting financially.

The supplies and professional work (elec, plumbing etc) is.This is a fantastic oppourtunity both for me, and for town, and I am really excited to share it with you! We can show people that Still lifes and Bucks County Landscapes...lovely as they may be, are NOT the only art around here! We CAN make New Hope cool again!!!
