The Glass Menagerie is set in the gritty working town of St. Louis at the end of the 1930’s. Characters Tom, Mother Amanda and Sister Laura live day to day with the absence of Tom’s father hanging over their every decision. Tom dreams of a life more exciting than working on the docks to support his family while Laura, sweet and shy, finds solace in her menagerie. Their once southern belle mother, Amanda, fights to hold on to the glory and promise of her youth, now starkly contrasted to their cramped city apartment. Tom, desperate to find an out to their stagnant existence invites Jim for dinner in what quickly becomes a pivotal moment that can make or break this desperate family forever.
Tennessee Williams’ play has been an American favorite since it’s Chicago premier 67 years ago. Long thought to be his most autobiographical play, the visceral emotions and predicaments of the Wingfield family still grab sharp relevance today. Without being socio-political, The Glass Menagerie asks a simple question that we all face in our lives: “Did I make the right choice?”
